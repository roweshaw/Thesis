  abstract = {Celery (Apium graveolens L.) plants were grown in pots in which the root system was separated from the soil in a side chamber by a fine mesh screen. The side chamber was treated with either an organic (ground plant tissue) or inorganic [(NH4)2SO4] source of 15N. Mycorrhizal (Glomus mosseae) and control (non-mycorrhizal) plants were exposed to 15N over a period of 30 days (inorganic-15N) or 88 days (organic-16N). Mycorrhizal and control plants did not differ in shoot dry weight or shoot P content. Dry weight of root was reduced in the mycorrhiza treatments. Mycorrhizal plants derived significantly (P= 0.01) more 16N, from both N sources, than did control plants. In the inorganic-N treatment, 15N in mycorrhizal plants was significantly (P= 0.001) and positively correlated with percent mycorrhizal fungal colonization (r= 0.58), number of hyphal crossings ({$\pm$}10 {$\mu$} diameter) through the mesh into the area of 15N placement (r= 0.76), total length of hyphae per gram of soil (r= 0.74), and length of hyphae of 5 {$\mu$} diameter in the soil (r= 0.77). No correlations were found between the 16N content of mycorrhizal plants and any parameter in the organic-N treatment. The 16N content of control plants was not correlated with hyphal length in the outer chamber and there were no hyphal crossings of the size ( 10 {$\mu$} diameter) which was counted for the mycorrhiza treatments. The presence of the organic matter (ground plant tissue) increased the total length of saprophytic hyphae per gram of soil but decreased the number of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae crossing into the area of 16N placement. The mean flux of N through the hyphae of G. mosseae was 7.42 \texttimes{} 10-8 mol N cm-2 s-1 for the inorganic-N treatment over a 30-day period, and 1.74 \texttimes{} 10-8 mol N cm-2 s-1 for the organic-N treatment over an 88-day period.},

These losses can be environmentally damaging and expensive in terms of lost agricultural production. Plants have evolved many traits to optimize nutrient acquisition, including the formation of arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations of plant roots with fungi that acquire soil nutrients. There is emerging evidence that AM have the ability to reduce nutrient loss from soils by enlarging the nutrient interception zone and preventing nutrient loss after rain-induced leaching events. Until recently, this important ecosystem service of AM had been largely overlooked. Here we review the role of AM in reducing nutrient loss and conclude that this role cannot be ignored if we are to increase global food production in an environmentally sustainable manner.},

This review explores questions such as: What makes the difference between a positive and a negative effect of AM on plant N nutrition? Is the mycorrhizal N response (MNR) correlated to the mycorrhizal growth response (MGR), and how or under which conditions? Is the MNR effect on plant growth C mediated? Is plant C investment on fungal growth related to N needs or N benefit? How is the N for C trade between symbionts regulated? The patternless nature of current knowledge is made evident, and possible reasons for this are discussed.},

  abstract = {Key enzymes of the urea cycle and 15N-labeling patterns of arginine (Arg) were measured to elucidate the involvement of Arg in nitrogen translocation by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Mycorrhiza was established between transformed carrot (Daucus carota) roots and Glomus intraradices in two-compartment petri dishes and three ammonium levels were supplied to the compartment containing the extraradical mycelium (ERM), but no roots. Time courses of specific enzyme activity were obtained for glutamine synthetase, argininosuccinate synthetase, arginase, and urease in the ERM and AM roots. 15NH4 ~+ was used to follow the dynamics of nitrogen incorporation into and turnover of Arg. Both the absence of external nitrogen and the presence of l-norvaline, an inhibitor of Arg synthesis, prevented the synthesis of Arg in the ERM and resulted in decreased activity of arginase and urease in the AM root. The catabolic activity of the urea cycle in the roots therefore depends on Arg translocation from the ERM. 15N labeling of Arg in the ERM was very fast and analysis of its time course and isotopomer pattern allowed estimation of the translocation rate of Arg along the mycelium as 0.13 {$\mu$}g Arg mg-1 fresh weight h-1. The results highlight the synchronization of the spatially separated reactions involved in the anabolic and catabolic arms of the urea cycle. This synchronization is a prerequisite for Arg to be a key component in nitrogen translocation in the AM mycelium.},

The most prominent contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to plant growth is due to uptake of nutrients by extraradical mycorrhizal hyphae. Quantification of hyphal nutrient uptake has become possible by the use of soil boxes with separated growing zones for roots and hyphae. Many (but not all) tested fungal isolates increased phosphorus and nitrogen uptake of the plant by absorbing phosphate, ammonium, and nitrate from soil. However, compared with the nutrient demand of the plant for growth, the contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to plant phosphorus uptake is usually much larger than the contribution to plant nitrogen uptake. The utilization of soil nutrients may depend more on efficient uptake of phosphate, nitrate, and ammonium from the soil solution even at low supply concentrations than on mobilization processes in the hyphosphere. In contrast to ectomycorrhizal fungi, nonsoluble nutrient sources in soil are used only to a limited extent by hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Side effects of mycorrhizal colonization on, for example, plant health or root activity may also influence plant nutrient uptake.},

This exchange is a significant factor in global nutrient cycles as well as in the ecology, evolution and physiology of plants. Despite its importance as a nutrient, very little is known about how AMF take up nitrogen and transfer it to their host plants. Here we report the results of stable isotope labelling experiments showing that inorganic nitrogen taken up by the fungus outside the roots is incorporated into amino acids, translocated from the extraradical to the intraradical mycelium as arginine, but transferred to the plant without carbon. Consistent with this mechanism, the genes of primary nitrogen assimilation are preferentially expressed in the extraradical tissues, whereas genes associated with arginine breakdown are more highly expressed in the intraradical mycelium. Strong changes in the expression of these genes in response to nitrogen availability and form also support the operation of this novel metabolic pathway in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.},

Analytical problems, the lower fractional abundance of N-15 than of C-13 in the biosphere, the greater complexity of the N cycle relative to the C cycle, and smaller expressed discriminations in nature, are contributing factors. The major N pools, globally, have different isotope signatures: atmospheric N2 is N-15-depleted relative to organic N (including sedimentary N), a situation resulting from a greater expressed discrimination in the organic N to N2 (via denitrification) reaction than of diazotrophy during accumulation of the reduced N. Essentially all of the enzymes except nitrogenase which transform N compounds show discrimination against N-15, although for glutamine synthetase, and the amination of 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate, this is only seen in terms of NH+4 rather than the true substrate, NH3. Discrimination is expressed in various N interconversions within plants, leading to substantial differences in deltaN-15 (up to 12 parts per thousand) among N compounds and macroscopic plant parts. N isotope fractionation during assimilation of exogenous combined N is often much lower than that expected from studies of isolated enzymes due to processes which show very little discrimination, such as limitation by transport through aqueous solution and membranes. Application of N-15/N-14 discrimination studies to plant ecology have concentrated largely on distinguishing diazotrophy from N supplied from combined N, based on the lower N-15/N-14 in diazotrophs due to the higher N-15/N-14 of combined N sources not being offset by fractionation during uptake. While potentially very useful, a number of pitfalls are discussed in its ecological use in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. N isotope discrimination is also useful in tracking N through food webs, and hence, back to combined N sources for plants.},

Arbuscular mycor - rhizae (AM) and ectomycorrhizae (EM) are the most important mycorrhizae in agricultural and natural ecosystems. AM and EM fungi use inorganic NH + 4 and NO - 3 , and most EM fungi are capable of using organic nitrogen. The heavier stable isotope 15 N is discriminated against during biogeochemical and biochemical processes. Differences in 15 N (atom\%) or {$\delta$} 15 N (\textperthousand ) provide nitrogen movement information in an experimental system. A range of 20 to 50\% of one - way N - transfer has been observed from legumes to nonlegumes. Mycorrhizal fungal mycelia can extend from one plant ' s roots to another plant ' s roots to form common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Individual species , genera , even families of plants can be interconnected by CMNs. They are capable of facilitating nutrient uptake and flux. Nutrients such as carbon , nitrogen and phosphorus and other elements may then move via either AM or EM networks from plant to plant. Both 15 N labeling and 15 N natural abundance techniques have been employed to trace N movement between plants interconnected by AM or EM networks. Fine mesh (25{$\sim$}45 \textmu m) has been used to separate root systems and allow only hyphal penetration and linkages but no root contact between plants.

The lack of convincing data underlines the need for creative , careful experimental manipulations.

It is thought that they possess no degradative capability and that they are unable to decompose complex organic molecules, the form in which most soil nutrients occur. Earlier suggestions that they could exist saprotrophically were based on observation of hyphal proliferation on organic materials3,4. In contrast, other mycorrhizal types have been shown to acquire nitrogen directly from organic sources5,6,7. Here we show that the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis can both enhance decomposition of and increase nitrogen capture from complex organic material (grass leaves) in soil. Hyphal growth of the fungal partner was increased in the presence of the organic material, independently of the host plant.},

Experiments on the relationship between the host plant and AM in soil or in sterile root-organ culture have provided clear evidence that the extraradical mycelia of AM fungi uptake various forms of nitrogen (N) and transport the assimilated N to the roots of the host plant. However, the uptake mechanisms of various forms of N and its translocation and transfer from the fungus to the host are virtually unknown. Therefore, there is a dearth of integrated models describing the movement of N through the AM fungal hyphae. Recent studies examined Ri T-DNA-transformed carrot roots colonized with AM fungi in 15N tracer experiments. In these experiments, the activities of key enzymes were determined, and expressions of genes related to N assimilation and translocation pathways were quantified. This review summarizes and discusses the results of recent research on the forms of N uptake, transport, degradation, and transfer to the roots of the host plant and the underlying mechanisms, as well as research on the forms of N and carbon used by germinating spores and their effects on amino acid metabolism. Finally, a pathway model summarizing the entire mechanism of N metabolism in AM fungi is outlined.},

The plants were grown together in PVC containers, either in symbiosis with Glomus intraradices Schenck and Smith or as non-mycorrhizal controls, and with their root systems separated by an intermediate buffer zone (2 cm), confined by fine nylon mesh. The pea donor plants were supplied simultaneously with 15N and 32P, using a split-root labelling technique, in order to follow the flow of N and P to the barley receiver plants during 60 d of growth. In half of the containers, the donor-plant shoot was removed 42 d after the start of labelling and the roots were left in the soil to decompose. The reverse transfer of N and P, from barley donor to pea receiver plants was also measured to allow calculation of the net transfer through hyphae between mycorrhizal donor and receiver plants. No significant transfer of N was detected from intact pea donor plants to the barley receiver plants in the non-mycorrhizal controls. Mycorrhizal colonization slightly increased the transfer of N. However, the net transfer of N was almost insignificant since N was also transferred in the reverse direction, from barley to pea. Removal of the pea donor-plant shoots increased the N transfer to 4\% of the donor-root N in the non-mycorrhizal controls. Contrastingly, 15\% of the donor-root N was transferred to the receiver plants, when plants were colonized by G. intraradices. The results for P transfer followed the same patterns as was observed for N, although in smaller proportions. The results indicate that arbuscular mycorrhizas may play a significant role in the flow of N and P between two plants interconnected by hyphae, when the root system of one of the plants is decomposing.},

We present a mathematical model describing a previously overlooked process: nitrogen isotope fractionation during leaf-atmosphere NH3(g) exchange. The model predicts that when leaf-atmosphere exchange of NH3(g) occurs in a closed system, the atmospheric reservoir of NH3(g) equilibrates at a concentration equal to the ammonia compensation point and an isotopic composition 8.1\textperthousand{} lighter than nitrogen in protein. In an open system, when atmospheric concentrations of NH3(g) fall below or rise above the compensation point, protein can be isotopically enriched by net efflux of NH3(g) or depleted by net uptake. Comparison of model output with existing measurements in the literature suggests that this process contributes to variation in the isotopic composition of nitrogen in plants as well as NH3(g) in the atmosphere, and should be considered in future analyses of nitrogen isotope circulation. The matrix-based modelling approach that is introduced may be useful for quantifying isotope dynamics in other complex systems that can be described by first-order kinetics.},

This study investigated the ability of two Glomus species to transfer N from organic material to host plants and examined whether the ability to capture N is related to fungal hyphal growth. Experimental microcosms had two compartments; these contained either a single plant of Plantago lanceolata inoculated with Glomus hoi or Glomus intraradices, or a patch of dried shoot material labelled with (15)N and (13)carbon (C). In one treatment, hyphae, but not roots, were allowed access to the patch; in the other treatment, access by both hyphae and roots was prevented. When allowed, fungi proliferated in the patch and captured N but not C, although G. intraradices transferred more N than G. hoi to the plant. Plants colonized with G. intraradices had a higher concentration of N than controls. Up to one-third of the patch N was captured by the AM fungi and transferred to the plant, while c. 20\% of plant N may have been patch derived. These findings indicate that uptake from organic N could be important in AM symbiosis for both plant and fungal partners and that some AM fungi may acquire inorganic N from organic sources.},

Mycorrhizal tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) colonized by Glomus mosseae were grown at  two N fertilizer concentrations in a root compartment. A PTFE membrane was placed between the root  compartment and an adjoining soil compartment that was inaccessible to the roots but accessible to the AMF  hyphae (hyphal compartment). Additional N was applied to the hyphal compartment using uniformly  15N-labelled NH4NO3. There was a flux of 15N from the hyphal compartment to the plants even in the absence of  mycorrhizal fungi. However, this flux was much higher in mycorrhizal plants, which had much higher N  concentrations in their shoots and roots than did the non-mycorrhizal control plants. This was particularly  apparent when the root compartment had a low N fertilizer concentration. Of the total N content of mycorrhizal  plants, c. 42 and 24\% at the low and high N fertilizer concentrations, respectively, were estimated to originate from  the hyphal compartment by transport through AMF hyphae. In the presence of mycorrhizal fungi, the flux of 15N  was about three times higher than in their absence.

These are; the ectomycorrhizas (ECM), the ericoid mycorrhizas (EM), and the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas (VAM). Mycorrhizal infection may affect the mineral nutrition of the host plant directly by enhancing plant growth through nutrient acquisition by the fungus, or indirectly by modifying transpiration rates and the composition of rhizosphere microflora. A capacity for the external hyphae to take up and deliver nutrients to the plant has been demonstrated for the following nutrients and mycorrhizas; P (VAM, EM, ECM), NH4 + (VAM, EM, ECM), NO3 - (ECM), K (VAM, ECM), Ca (VAM, EM), SO4 2- (VAM), Cu (VAM), Zn (VAM) and Fe (EM). In experimental chambers, the external hyphae of VAM can deliver up to 80\% of plant P, 25\% of plant N, 10\% of plant K, 25\% of plant Zn and 60\% of plant Cu. Knowledge of the role of mycorrhiza in the uptake of nutrients other than P and N is limited because definitive studies are few, especially for the ECM. Although further quantification is required, it is feasible that the external hyphae may provide a significant delivery system for N, K, Cu and Zn in addition to P in many soils. Proposals that ECM and VAM fungi contribute substantially to the Mg, B and Fe nutrition of the host plant have not been substantiated. ECM and EM fungi produce ectoenzymes which provide host plants with the potential to access organic N and P forms that are normally unavailable to VAM fungi or to non mycorrhizal roots. The relative contribution of these nutrient sources requires quantification in the field. Further basic research, including the quantification of nutrient uptake and transport by fungal hyphae in soil and regulation at the fungal-plant interface, is essential to support the selection and utilization of mycorrhizal fungi on a commercial scal},

This symbiotic relationship is crucial for the nitrogen cycle, and understanding symbiotic mechanisms is a scientific challenge with direct applications in agronomy and plant development. Rhizobium etli is a bacteria which provides legumes with ammonia (among other chemical compounds), thereby stimulating plant growth. A genome-scale approach, integrating the biochemical information available for R. etli, constitutes an important step toward understanding the symbiotic relationship and its possible improvement. In this work we present a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction (iOR363) for R. etli CFN42, which includes 387 metabolic and transport reactions across 26 metabolic pathways. This model was used to analyze the physiological capabilities of R. etli during stages of nitrogen fixation. To study the physiological capacities in silico, an objective function was formulated to simulate symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Flux balance analysis (FBA) was performed, and the predicted active metabolic pathways agreed qualitatively with experimental observations. In addition, predictions for the effects of gene deletions during nitrogen fixation in Rhizobia in silico also agreed with reported experimental data. Overall, we present some evidence supporting that FBA of the reconstructed metabolic network for R. etli provides results that are in agreement with physiological observations. Thus, as for other organisms, the reconstructed genome-scale metabolic network provides an important framework which allows us to compare model predictions with experimental measurements and eventually generate hypotheses on ways to improve nitrogen fixation.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can perform key roles in ecosystem functioning through improving host nutrient acquisition. Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plant growth, however, anthropogenic N loading (e.g. crop fertilization and deposition from combustion sources) is increasing so that N now threatens ecosystem sustainability around the world by causing terrestrial and aquatic eutrophication and acidification. It is impor- tant to better understand the capacity of AMF to directly uptake N from soils and transfer it to host plants because this process may increase N recycling and retention within ecosystems. In addition to understanding the role of AMF in the N cycle in the present day it is important to understand how AMF function may change as global change proceeds. Currently the net effects of N enrichment and elevated temperature predicted with global change on AMF are unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of N enrichment by simulated N- deposition loading, elevated temperatures expected by future global changes and their interactions on growth and AMF-mediated N acquisition of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum var. Alamo), an important species for biofuel production. Switchgrass plants were grown in microcosm units that divided mycorrhizal roots from AMF hyphae and organic residues enriched with 15N by compartments separated by an air gap to reduce N diffusion. While AMF did not enhance switchgrass biomass, mycorrhizas significantly increased 15N in shoots and total shoot N. Neither N enrichment nor elevated temperatures influenced this mycorrhizal-mediated N uptake and transfer. Results from this study can aid in developing sustainable bioethanol and switchgrass production prac- tices that are less reliant on synthetic fertilizers and more dependent on internal N recycling from AMF.},

  abstract = {The arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) brings together the roots of over 80\% of land plant species and fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota and greatly benefits plants through improved uptake of mineral nutrients. AM fungi can take up both nitrate and ammonium from the soil and transfer nitrogen (N) to host roots in nutritionally substantial quantities. The current model of N handling in the AM symbiosis includes the synthesis of arginine in the extraradical mycelium and the transfer of arginine to the intraradical mycelium, where it is broken down to release N for transfer to the host plant. To understand the mechanisms and regulation of N transfer from the fungus to the plant, 11 fungal genes putatively involved in the pathway were identified from Glomus intraradices, and for six of them the full-length coding sequence was functionally characterized by yeast complementation. Two glutamine synthetase isoforms were found to have different substrate affinities and expression patterns, suggesting different roles in N assimilation. The spatial and temporal expression of plant and fungal N metabolism genes were followed after nitrate was added to the extraradical mycelium under N-limited growth conditions using hairy root cultures. In parallel experiments with (15)N, the levels and labeling of free amino acids were measured to follow transport and metabolism. The gene expression pattern and profiling of metabolites involved in the N pathway support the idea that the rapid uptake, translocation, and transfer of N by the fungus successively trigger metabolic gene expression responses in the extraradical mycelium, intraradical mycelium, and host plant.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen metabolism was examined in monoxenic cultures of carrot roots (Daucus carota L.) colonized with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices Schenck \& Smith. Glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase activities were significantly increased in mycorrhizal roots for which only the extraradical mycelium had exclusive access to NH4NO3 in a distinct hyphal compartment inaccessible to the roots. This was in comparison with the water controls but was similar to the enzyme activities of non-arbuscular-mycorrhizal (non-AM) roots that had direct access to NH4NO3. In addition, glutamate dehydrogenase activity was significantly enhanced in AM roots compared with non-AM roots. Carrot roots took up 15NH4+ more efficiently than 15NO3-, and the extraradical hyphae transfered 15NH4+ to host roots from the hyphal compartment but did not transfer 15NO3-. The extraradical mycelium was shown, for the first time, to have a different glutamine synthetase monomer than roots. Our overall results highlight the active role of AM fungi in nitrogen uptake, transfer, and assimilation in their symbiotic root association.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition alters ectomycorrhizal fungal communities, but the effect on functional diversity is not clear. In this review we explore whether fungi that respond differently to N deposition also differ in functional traits, including organic N use, hydrophobicity and exploration type (extent and pattern of extraradical hyphae). Cortinarius, Tricholoma, Piloderma, and Suillus had the strongest evidence of consistent negative effects of N deposition. Cortinarius, Tricholoma and Piloderma display consistent protein use and produce medium-distance fringe exploration types with hydrophobic mycorrhizas and rhizomorphs. Genera that produce long-distance exploration types (mostly Boletales) and contact short-distance exploration types (e.g., Russulaceae, Thelephoraceae, some athelioid genera) vary in sensitivity to N deposition. Members of Bankeraceae have declined in Europe but their enzymatic activity and belowground occurrence are largely unknown. Bankeraceae produce a distinct hydrophobic mat exploration type that may also be important in N acquisition under conditions of low N availability. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

  abstract = {Soybean/maize intercropping has remarkable advantages in increasing crop yield and nitrogen (N) efficiency. However, little is known about the contributions of rhizobia or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to yield increases and N acquisition in the intercropping system. Plus, the mechanisms controlling carbon (C) and N allocation in intercropping systems remain unsettled. In the present study, a greenhouse experiment combined with (15)N and (13)C labeling was conducted using various inoculation and nutrient treatments. The results showed that co-inoculation with AMF and rhizobia dramatically increased biomass and N content of soybean and maize, and moderate application of N and phosphorus largely amplified the effect of co-inoculation. Maize had a competitive advantage over soybean only under co-inoculation and moderate nutrient availability conditions, indicating that the effects of AMF and rhizobia in intercropping systems are closely related to nutrient status. Results from (15)N labeling showed that the amount of N transferred from soybean to maize in co-inoculations was 54\% higher than that with AMF inoculation alone, with this increased N transfer partly resulting from symbiotic N fixation. The results from (13)C labeling showed that (13)C content increased in maize shoots and decreased in soybean roots with AMF inoculation compared to uninoculated controls. Yet, with co-inoculation, (13)C content increased in soybean. These results indicate that photosynthate assimilation is stimulated by AM symbiosis in maize and rhizobial symbiosis in soybean, but AMF inoculation leads to soybean investing more carbon than maize into common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Overall, the results herein demonstrate that the growth advantage of maize when intercropped with soybean is due to acquisition of N by maize via CMNs while this crop contributes less C into CMNs than soybean under co-inoculation conditions.},
