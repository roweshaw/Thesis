  abstract = {Abiotic stresses hamper plant growth and productivity. Climate change and agricultural malpractices like excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides have aggravated the effects of abiotic stresses on crop productivity and degraded the ecosystem. There is an urgent need for environment-friendly management techniques such as the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for enhancing crop productivity. AMF are commonly known as bio-fertilizers. Moreover, it is widely believed that the inoculation of AMF provides tolerance to host plants against various stressful situations like heat, salinity, drought, metals, and extreme temperatures. AMF may both assist host plants in the up-regulation of tolerance mechanisms and prevent the down-regulation of key metabolic pathways. AMF, being natural root symbionts, provide essential plant inorganic nutrients to host plants, thereby improving growth and yield under unstressed and stressed regimes. The role of AMF as a bio-fertilizer can potentially strengthen plants' adaptability to changing environment. Thus, further research focusing on the AMF-mediated promotion of crop quality and productivity is needed. The present review provides a comprehensive up-to-date knowledge on AMF and their influence on host plants at various growth stages, their advantages and applications, and consequently the importance of the relationships of different plant nutrients with AMF.},

Frank and G. Gibelli described the surprisingly morphology of forest tree roots surrounded by a fungal mantle. Compared with this history, our molecular study of mycorrhizas remains a young science. To trace the history of mycorrhizal research, from its roots in the distant past, to the present and the future, this review outlines a few topics that were already central in the 19th century and were seminal in revealing the biological meaning of mycorrhizal associations. These include investigations of nutrient exchange between partners, plant responses to mycorrhizal fungi, and the identity and evolution of mycorrhizal symbionts as just a few examples of how the most recent molecular studies of mycorrhizal biology sprouted from the roots of past research. In addition to clarifying the ecological role of mycorrhizas, some of the recent results have changed the perception of the relevance of mycorrhizas in the scientific community, and in the whole of society. Looking to past knowledge while foreseeing strategies for the next steps can help us catch a glimpse of the future of mycorrhizal research.},

We then discuss, in the context of nutritional strategies, the mechanisms that operate among members of the consortium and that often promote plant growth. Release of active molecules, including volatiles, and physical contact among the partners seem important for the establishment of the bacteria/mycorrhizal fungus/plant network.

The contribution of the AM symbiosis to the phosphate nutrition has long been known, but whether AM fungi contribute similarly to the nitrogen nutrition of their host is still controversially discussed. However, there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that AM fungi can actively transfer nitrogen to their host, and that the host plant with its carbon supply stimulates this transport, and that the periarbuscular membrane of the host is able to facilitate the active uptake of nitrogen from the mycorrhizal interface. In this review, our current knowledge about nitrogen transport through the fungal hyphae and across the mycorrhizal interface is summarized, and we discuss the regulation of these pathways and major research gaps.},

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered the most important type of mycorrhizae for phytoremediation. AMF have broad occurrence in contaminated soils, and evidences suggest they improve plant tolerance to excess of certain trace elements. In this review, the use of AMF in phytoremediation and mechanisms involved in their trace element tolerance are discussed. Additionally, we present some techniques used to study the retention of trace elements by AMF, as well as a summary of studies showing major benefits of AMF for phytoremediation.},

These losses can be environmentally damaging and expensive in terms of lost agricultural production. Plants have evolved many traits to optimize nutrient acquisition, including the formation of arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations of plant roots with fungi that acquire soil nutrients. There is emerging evidence that AM have the ability to reduce nutrient loss from soils by enlarging the nutrient interception zone and preventing nutrient loss after rain-induced leaching events. Until recently, this important ecosystem service of AM had been largely overlooked. Here we review the role of AM in reducing nutrient loss and conclude that this role cannot be ignored if we are to increase global food production in an environmentally sustainable manner.},

Furthermore, recent evidence provided new insight into the exchange of nutritional benefits between the symbiotic partners. The great potential for application of AM has given rise to a thriving industry for AM-related products for agriculture, horticulture, and landscaping.

Most soils have a deficiency of available P; if they are not fertilized, they will not be able to satisfy the P requirement of plants. P fertilization is generally recommended to manage soil P deficiency; however, the low efficacy of P fertilizers in acidic and in calcareous soils restricts P availability. Moreover, the overuse of P fertilizers is a cause of significant environmental concerns. However, the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), phosphate\textendash solubilizing bacteria (PSB), and the addition of silicon (Si) are effective and economical ways to improve the availability and efficacy of P. In this review the contributions of Si, PSB, and AMF in improving the P availability is discussed. Based on what is known about them, the combined strategy of using Si along with AMF and PSB may be highly useful in improving the P availability and as a result, its uptake by plants compared to using either of them alone. A better understanding how the two microorganism groups and Si interact is crucial to preserving soil fertility and improving the economic and environmental sustainability of crop production in P deficient soils. This review summarizes and discusses the current knowledge concerning the interactions among AMF, PSB, and Si in enhancing P availability and its uptake by plants in sustainable agriculture.},

The universal 450-million-yr-old arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) (fungus-root) symbioses are one of the most successful and widespread strategies to maximize access of plants to available P. AM fungi biotrophically colonize the root cortex of most plant species and develop an extraradical mycelium which overgrows the nutrient depletion zone of the soil surrounding plant roots. This hyphal network is specialized in the acquisition of low mobility nutrients from soil, particularly P. During the last years, molecular biology techniques coupled to novel physiological approaches have provided fascinating contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms of symbiotic P transport. Mycorrhiza-specific plant phosphate transporters, which are required not only for symbiotic P transfer but also for maintenance of the symbiosis, have been identified. The present review provides an overview of the contribution of AM fungi to plant P acquisition and an update of recent findings on the physiological, molecular and regulatory mechanisms of P transport in the AM symbiosis.},

In this review, we describe the method by which root-organ cultures (transformed and nontransformed) have been obtained, together with the choice of host species, inoculation techniques, and culture media. We also outline the potential use of continuous cultures and cryopreservation of in vitro produced spores for long-term germ plasm storage. Furthermore, this review highlights the considerable impact that in vitro root-organ cultures have had on studies of AM fungal morphology, taxonomy, and phylogeny and how they have improved our understanding of the processes leading to root colonization and development of the extraradical mycelium. This is supported by a summary of some of the most important findings, regarding this symbiosis, that have been made at the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels. We also summarize results from studies between AM fungi and certain pathogenic and nonpathogenic soil microorganisms. We describe some of the limitations of this in vitro system and propose diverse avenues of AM research that can now be undertaken, including the potential use of a similar system for ectomycorrhizal research.},

Analytical problems, the lower fractional abundance of 15N than of 13C in the biosphere, the greater complexity of the N cycle relative to the C cycle, and smaller expressed discriminations in nature, are contributing factors. The major N pools, globally, have different isotope signatures: atmospheric N2 is 15N-depleted relative to organic N (including sedimentary N), a situation resulting from a greater expressed discrimination in the organic N to N2 (via denitrification) reaction than of diazotrophy during accumulation of the reduced N. Essentially all of the enzymes except nitrogenase which transform N compounds show discrimination against 15N, although for glutamine synthetase, and the amination of 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate, this is only seen in terms of NH4+ rather than the true substrate, NH3. Discrimination is expressed in various N interconversions within plants, leading to substantial differences in {$\delta$}15N (up to 12\textperthousand ) among N compounds and macroscopic plant parts. N isotope fractionation during assimilation of exogenous combined N is often much lower than that expected from studies of isolated enzymes due to processes which show very little discrimination, such as limitation by transport through aqueous solution and membranes. Application of 15N/14N discrimination studies to plant ecology have concentrated largely on distinguishing diazotrophy from N supplied from combined N, based on the lower 15N/14N in diazotrophs due to the higher 15N/14N of combined N sources not being offset by fractionation during uptake. While potentially very useful, a number of pitfalls are discussed in its ecological use in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. N isotope discrimination is also useful in tracking N through food webs, and hence, back to combined N sources for plants.},

  abstract = {AbstractMany microorganisms form symbioses with plants that range, on a continuous scale, from parasitic to mutualistic. Among these, the most widespread mutualistic symbiosis is the arbuscular mycorrhiza, formed between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and vascular flowering plants. These associations occur in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world and have a global impact on plant phosphorus nutrition. The arbuscular mycorrhiza is an endosymbiosis in which the fungus inhabits the root cortical cells and obtains carbon provided by the plant while it transfers mineral nutrients from the soil to the cortical cells. Development of the symbiosis involves the differentiation of both symbionts to create novel symbiotic interfaces within the root cells. The aim of this review is to explore the current understanding of the signals and signaling pathways used by the symbionts for the development of the AM symbiosis. Although the signal molecules used for initial communication are not yet known, recent studies point to their existence. Within the plant, there is evidence of arbuscular mycorrhiza-specific signals and of systemic signaling that influences phosphate-starvation responses and root development. The landmark cloning of three plant signaling proteins required for the development of the symbiosis has provided the first insights into a signaling pathway that is used by AM fungi and by rhizobia for their symbiotic associations with legumes.},

Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and ectomycorrhizae (EM) are the most important mycorrhizae in agricultural and natural ecosystems. AM and EM fungi use inorganic NH4 + and NO3 -, and most EM fungi are capable of using organic nitrogen. The heavier stable isotope 15N is discriminated against during biogeochemical and biochemical processes. Differences in 15N (atom\%) or {$\delta$}15N (\textperthousand ) provide nitrogen movement information in an experimental system. A range of 20 to 50\% of one-way N-transfer has been observed from legumes to nonlegumes. Mycorrhizal fungal mycelia can extend from one plant's roots to another plant's roots to form common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Individual species, genera, even families of plants can be interconnected by CMNs. They are capable of facilitating nutrient uptake and flux. Nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and other elements may then move via either AM or EM networks from plant to plant. Both 15N labeling and 15N natural abundance techniques have been employed to trace N movement between plants interconnected by AM or EM networks. Fine mesh (25{$\sim$}45 {$\mu$}m) has been used to separate root systems and allow only hyphal penetration and linkages but no root contact between plants. In many studies, nitrogen from N2-fixing mycorrhizal plants transferred to non-N2\textendash fixing mycorrhizal plants (one-way N-transfer). In a few studies, N is also transferred from non-N2\textendash fixing mycorrhizal plants to N2-fixing mycorrhizal plants (two-way N-transfer). There is controversy about whether N-transfer is direct through CMNs, or indirect through the soil. The lack of convincing data underlines the need for creative, careful experimental manipulations. Nitrogen is crucial to productivity in most terrestrial ecosystems, and there are potential benefits of management in soil-plant systems to enhance N-transfer. Thus, two-way N-transfer warrants further investigation with many species and under field conditions.},

Roots experiencing nutrient-rich patches can also enhance their physiological ion-uptake capacities compared with roots of the same plant outside the patch zone. These plastic responses by the root system have been proposed as the major mechanism by which plants cope with the naturally occurring heterogeneous supplies of nutrients in soil. Various attempts to predict how contrasting species will respond to patches have been made based on specific root length (SRL), root demography and biomass allocation within the patch zone. No one criterion has proved definitive. Actually demonstrating that root proliferation is beneficial to the plant, especially in terms of nitrogen capture from patches, has also proved troublesome. Yet by growing plants under more realistic conditions, such as in interspecific plant competition, and with a complex organic patch, a direct benefit can be demonstrated.

The composition of the AMF communities in the roots was assessed using real-time PCR to determine the copy number of large ribosomal subunit genes. ??Fungal communities in the roots were usually dominated by one AMF species (G. mosseae). The composition of the communities depended on both plant identity and the time of harvest. Leek colonized by a mixture of G. claroideum and G. intraradices acquired more P than with either of the two AMF separately. ??Direct evidence is provided for functional complementarity among species within the AMF community colonizing a single root system. Competition among the species poses a major challenge in interpreting experiments with mixed inoculations, but this is greatly facilitated by use of real-time PCR.},

This widespread coexistence of plants and fungi has important consequences for plant mineral nutrition, water acquisition, carbon allocation, tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses and interplant competition. Yet some current research indicates a number of important roles to be played by hyphae-associated microbes, in addition to the hyphae themselves, in foraging for and acquisition of soil resources and in transformation of organic carbon in the soil-plant systems. We critically review the available scientific evidence for the theory that the surface of mycorrhizal hyphae in soil is colonized by highly specialized microbial communities, and that these fulfill important functions in the ecology of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae such as accessing recalcitrant forms of mineral nutrients, and production of signaling and other compounds in the vicinity of the hyphae. The validity of another hypothesis will then be addressed, namely that the specific associative microbes are rewarded with exclusive access to fungal carbon, which would qualify them as hypersymbionts (i.e., symbionts of symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi). Thereafter, we ask whether recruitment of functionally different microbial assemblages by the hyphae is required under different soil conditions (questioning what evidence is available for such an effect), and we identify knowledge gaps requiring further attention.},

Experiments on the relationship between the host plant and AM in soil or in sterile root-organ culture have provided clear evidence that the extraradical mycelia of AM fungi uptake various forms of nitrogen (N) and transport the assimilated N to the roots of the host plant. However, the uptake mechanisms of various forms of N and its translocation and transfer from the fungus to the host are virtually unknown. Therefore, there is a dearth of integrated models describing the movement of N through the AM fungal hyphae. Recent studies examined Ri T-DNA-transformed carrot roots colonized with AM fungi in 15N tracer experiments. In these experiments, the activities of key enzymes were determined, and expressions of genes related to N assimilation and translocation pathways were quantified. This review summarizes and discusses the results of recent research on the forms of N uptake, transport, degradation, and transfer to the roots of the host plant and the underlying mechanisms, as well as research on the forms of N and carbon used by germinating spores and their effects on amino acid metabolism. Finally, a pathway model summarizing the entire mechanism of N metabolism in AM fungi is outlined.},

In natural habitats, and in an ecologically meaningful time span, these associations have evolved to improve the fitness of both plant and fungal symbionts. In systems managed by humans, mycorrhizal associations often improve plant productivity, but this is not always the case. Mycorrhizal fungi might be considered to be parasitic on plants when net cost of the symbiosis exceeds net benefits. Parasitism can be developmentally induced, environmentally induced, or possibly genotypically induced. Morphological, phenological, and physiological characteristics of the symbionts influence the functioning of mycorrhizas at an individual scale. Biotic and abiotic factors at the rhizosphere, community, and ecosystem scales further mediate mycorrhizal functioning. Despite the complexity of mycorrhizal associations, it might be possible to construct predictive models of mycorrhizal functioning. These models will need to incorporate variables and parameters that account for differences in plant responses to, and control of, mycorrhizal fungi, and differences in fungal effects on, and responses to, the plant. Developing and testing quantitative models of mycorrhizal functioning in the real world requires creative experimental manipulations and measurements. This work will be facilitated by recent advances in molecular and biochemical techniques. A greater understanding of how mycorrhizas function in complex natural systems is a prerequisite to managing them in agriculture, forestry, and restoration.},

Yet, the evolutionary stability of mycorrhizal associations is still poorly understood, as it follows none of the constraints thought to stabilize cooperation in other well-known mutualisms. The capacity of both host and symbiont to simultaneously interact with several partners introduces a unique dilemma; detecting and punishing those exploiting the mutualism becomes increasingly difficult if these individuals can continue to access resources from alternative sources. Here, we explore four hypotheses to explain evolutionary cooperation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis: (1) pseudo-vertical transmission and spatial structuring of plant and fungal populations leading to local adaptation of partners; (2) luxury resource exchange in which plants trade surplus carbon for excess fungal nutrients; (3) partner choice allowing partners to associate with better cooperators; and (4) host and symbiont sanctions which actively reward good partners and punish less cooperative ones. We propose that mycorrhizal cooperation is promoted by an exchange of surplus resources between partners and enforced through sanctions by one or both partners. These mechanisms may allow plant and fungal genotypes to discriminate against individuals employing exploitative strategies, promoting patterns of partner choice. Together these selection pressures provide a framework for understanding the stabilization of mycorrhizal cooperation over evolutionary time.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen is the major nutrient limiting plant growth in terrestrial ecosystems, and the transformation of inert nitrogen to forms that can be assimilated by plants is mediated by soil micro-organisms. The last decade has witnessed many significant advances in our understanding of plant\textendash microbe interactions with evidence that plants have evolved multiple strategies to cope with nitrogen limitation by shaping and recruiting nitrogen-cycling microbial communities. However, most studies have typically focused on the impact of plants on only one, or relatively few, processes within the nitrogen cycle. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of the various routes by which plants influence the availability of nitrogen via an array of interactions with different guilds of nitrogen-cycling micro-organisms. We also propose a plant trait-based framework for linking plant nitrogen acquisition strategies to the activities of nitrogen-cycling microbial guilds. In doing so, we provide a more comprehensive picture of the ecological relationships between plants and nitrogen-cycling micro-organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, we identify previously overlooked processes within the nitrogen cycle that could be targeted in future research and be of interest for plant health or for improving plant nitrogen acquisition, while minimizing nitrogen inputs and losses in sustainable agricultural systems.

  abstract = {Walnut trees are among the most important hardwood species in the northern hemisphere, ecologically and economically. They are mainly cultivated for timber and nut production but are also attractive ornamental trees in parks. Establishing walnut orchards is difficult because seedlings have a coarse root architecture and few of them survive to transplanting. Planting success is mainly determined by the root system morphology and the nutrient status of the seedlings, so that rhizosphere conditions are critical for plant performance. Walnut trees can associate with soil-borne arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which are obligate biotrophs. In this association, plant-produced carbon compounds are traded against fungus-acquired soil mineral nutrients. The beneficial effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis on hardwood seedling quality and field performance has long been known, but an integrated view is lacking about the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizas on walnut cropping. Therefore, we surveyed the literature published over the last 40~years to provide up-to-date knowledge on the relationships between arbuscular mycorrhizas and walnut trees. Our review outlines the major following points: (1) the arbuscular-mycorrhiza-mediated nutrient uptake capacity of walnut trees is associated with first- to third-order roots, and fibrous tip-ended roots are dependent on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whereas pioneer roots are not; (2) early inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improves the survival and seedling performance attributes of transplanted walnut trees: biotization enhances walnut transplant success by increasing the number of lateral roots and plant P uptake, but these benefits are fungus- and host-dependent; (3) in the context of walnut agroforestry, deeply rooted walnut trees play a role as reservoirs of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal propagules for the surrounding vegetation, but tree shade and soluble phosphate availability decrease walnut mycorrhizal dependency; and (4) the arbuscular mycorrhizal mycelium mediates the transport of juglone and thus plays a role in walnut tree allelopathy.},

First, fungal `trading agents' are hard to identify because AMFs are potentially heterokaryotic, that is, they may contain large numbers of polymorphic nuclei. This means it is difficult to define and study a fungal `individual' acting as an independent agent with a specific trading strategy. Second, because nutrient exchanges occur via communal structures (arbuscules), this temporarily reduces outbidding competition and transaction costs and hence resembles exchanges among divisions of firms, rather than traditional trade on markets. We discuss how fungal nuclei may coordinate their trading strategies, but nevertheless retain some independence, similar to human co-operatives (co-ops).},

In the last decade, remediation of the agricultural polluted soil has attracted great attention. Phytoremediation is one of the technologies that effectively alleviate heavy metal toxicity, however, this technique is limited to many factors contributing to low plant growth rate and nature of metal toxicities. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) assisted alleviation of heavy metal phytotoxicity is a cost-effective and environment-friendly strategy. AMF have a symbiotic relationship with the host plant. The bidirectional exchange of resources is a hallmark and also a functional necessity in mycorrhizal symbiosis. During the last few years, a significant progress in both physiological and molecular mechanisms regarding roles of AMF in the alleviation of heavy metals (HMs) toxicities in plants, acquisition of nutrients, and improving plant performance under toxic conditions of HMs has been well studied. This review summarized the current knowledge regarding AMF assisted remediation of heavy metals and some of the strategies used by mycorrhizal fungi to cope with stressful environments. Moreover, this review provides the information of both molecular and physiological responses of mycorrhizal plants as well as AMF to heavy metal stress which could be helpful for exploring new insight into the mechanisms of HMs remediation by utilizing AMF.},

An environmentally-friendly way to achieve the former objectives is represented by the biostimulant functions displayed by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). AMF support plant nutrition by absorbing and translocating mineral nutrients beyond the depletion zones of plant rhizosphere (biofertilisers) and induce changes in secondary metabolism leading to improved nutraceutical compounds. In addition, AMF interfere with the phytohormone balance of host plants, thereby influencing plant development (bioregulators) and inducing tolerance to soil and environmental stresses (bioprotector). Maximum benefits from AMF activity will be achieved by adopting beneficial farming practices (e.g. reduction of chemical fertilisers and biocides), by inoculating efficient AMF strains and also by the appropriate selection of plant host/fungus combinations. This review gives an up to date overview of the recent advances in the production of quality AMF inocula and in the biostimulant properties of AMF on plant health, nutrition and quality of horticultural crops (fruit trees, vegetables, flower crops and ornamentals). The agronomical, physiological and biochemical processes conferring tolerance to drought, salinity, nutrient deficiency, heavy metal contaminations and adverse soil pH in mycorrhizal plants are encompassed. In addition, the influence of bacterial interactions and farm management on AMF is discussed. Finally, the review identifies several future research areas relevant to AMF to exploit and improve the biostimulant effects of AMF in horticulture.},

These are the less investigated mycorrhizae helper bacteria (MHB), which constitute a dense, active bacterial community, tightly associated with AMF, and involved in the development and functioning of AMF. Although AMF spores are known to host several bacteria in their spore walls and cytoplasm, their role in promoting the ecological fitness and establishment of AMF symbiosis by influencing spore germination, mycelial growth, root colonization, metabolic diversity, and biocontrol of soil borne diseases is now being deciphered. MHB also promote the functioning of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by triggering various plant growth factors, leading to better availability of nutrients in the soil and uptake by plants. In order to develop strategies to promote mycorrhization by AMF, and particularly to stimulate the ability to utilize phosphorus from the soil, there is a need to decipher crucial metabolic signalling pathways of MHB and elucidate their functional significance as mycorrhiza helper bacteria. MHB, also referred to as AMF bioenhancers, also improve agronomic efficiency and formulations using AMF along with enriched population of MHB are a promising option. This review covers the aspects related to the specificity and mechanisms of action of MHB, which positively impact the formation and functioning of AMF in mycorrhizal symbiosis, and the need to advocate MHB as AMF bioenhancers towards their inclusion in integrated nutrient management practices in sustainable agriculture.},

This review discusses the recent progress and challenges in our understanding of the characteristics, functions, ecology and models of mycorrhizal networks, with the goal of encouraging future research to improve our understanding of their ecology, adaptability and evolution. We focus on four themes in the recent literature: (1) the physical, physiological and molecular evidence for the existence of mycorrhizal networks, as well as the genetic characteristics and topology of networks in natural ecosystems; (2) the types, amounts and mechanisms of interplant material transfer (including carbon, nutrients, water, defence signals and allelochemicals) in autotrophic, mycoheterotrophic or partial mycoheterotrophic plants, with particular focus on carbon transfer; (3) the influence of mycorrhizal networks on plant establishment, survival and growth, and the implications for community diversity or stability in response to environmental stress; and (4) insights into emerging methods for modelling the spatial configuration and temporal dynamics of mycorrhizal networks, including the inclusion of mycorrhizal networks in conceptual models of complex adaptive systems. We suggest that mycorrhizal networks are fundamental agents of complex adaptive systems (ecosystems) because they provide avenues for feedbacks and cross-scale interactions that lead to selforganization and emergent properties in ecosystems. We have found that research in the genetics of mycorrhizal networks has accelerated rapidly in the past 5 y with increasing resolution and throughput of molecular tools, but there still remains a large gap between understanding genes and understanding the physiology, ecology and evolution of mycorrhizal networks in our changing environment. There is now enormous and exciting potential for mycorrhizal researchers to address these higher level questions and thus inform ecosystem and evolutionary research more broadly.},

  abstract = {Recent research on arbuscular mycorrhizas has demonstrated that AM fungi play a significant role in plant phosphorus (P) uptake, regardless of whether the plant responds positively to colonization in terms of growth or P content. Here we focus particularly on implications of this finding for consideration of the balance between organic carbon (C) use by the fungi and P delivery (i.e. the C\textendash P trade between the symbionts). Positive growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization are attributed frequently to increased P uptake via the fungus, which results in relief of P deficiency and increased growth. Zero AM responses, compared with non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants, have conventionally been attributed to failure of the fungi to deliver P to the plants. Negative responses, combined with excessive C use, have been attributed to this failure. The fungi were viewed as parasites. Demonstration that the AM pathway of P uptake operates in such plants indicates that direct P uptake by the roots is reduced and that the fungi are not parasites but mutualists because they deliver P as well as using C. We suggest that poor plant growth is the result of P deficiency because AM fungi lower the amount of P taken up directly by roots but the AM uptake of P does compensate for the reduction. The implications of interplay between direct root uptake and AM fungal uptake of P also include increased tolerance of AM plants to toxins such as arsenate and increased success when competing with NM plants. Finally we discuss the new information on C\textendash P trade in the context of control of the symbiosis by the fungus or the plant, including new information (from NM plants) on sugar transport and on the role of sucrose in the signaling network involved in responses of plants to P deprivation.},

  abstract = {This review brings together recent work on the coordination of transport processes between fungus and plant symbionts in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses, and focuses on new information on the diversity in structure and function of interfaces and their potential roles in transport processes. We consider the way that fungal activity is polarised to absorb mineral nutrients (especially phosphorus, P) in soil, transport them to the root and release them to the plant. Conversely, the fungal structures within the root appear to be specialised to absorb sugars, which the external mycelium cannot do. The external mycelium depends on a supply of lipid, transported from within the root. High affinity P transporters expressed in the root apices and root hairs of non-mycorrhizal roots, and most probably mycorrhizal roots, absorb P actively. This can result in the development of P depletion zones, so that a low concentration of P at the absorbing surfaces limits further uptake. The external hyphae of AM fungi extend well beyond the depletion zone, accessing supplies of P at a distance and in narrow soil pores, that is absorbed actively by a high affinity P transporter expressed in these small diameter hyphae. Translocation of P within the hyphae and transfer to the plant results in much higher rates of uptake (inflows) by mycorrhizal than non-mycorrhizal roots. The possible role of polyphosphate (polyP) in this process is discussed in the light of new data. Within the root, P is lost from the fungal structures to the interfacial apoplast by an unknown mechanism, and is absorbed by the root cortical cells. The expression of a high affinity P transporter and H + -ATPase in arbuscule-containing cells indicates that these are probably the sites of fungus/plant P transfer. The site of sugar transfer from plant to fungus has not yet been established. At the whole plant level, plant uptake systems located in the youngest regions of the root are positioned to absorb P from undepleted soil, into which the root apex has just grown. In older regions of the roots, colonised by mycorrhizal fungi, the external mycelium will take over the absorptive role and overcome the difficulties posed by the slow diffusion of P in soil.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses are formed by approximately 80\% of vascular plant species in all major terrestrial biomes. In consequence an understanding of their functions is critical in any study of sustainable agricultural or natural ecosystems. Here we discuss the implications of recent results and ideas on AM symbioses that are likely to be of particular significance for plants dealing with abiotic stresses such as nutrient deficiency and especially water stress. In order to ensure balanced coverage, we also include brief consideration of the ways in which AM fungi may influence soil structure, carbon deposition in soil and interactions with the soil microbial and animal populations, as well as plant-plant competition. These interlinked outcomes of AM symbioses go well beyond effects in increasing nutrient uptake that are commonly discussed and all require to be taken into consideration in future work designed to understand the complex and multifaceted responses of plants to abiotic and biotic stresses in agricultural and natural environments.},

  abstract = {The 20th century saw dramatic increases in agricultural productivity, largely through the development and application of pesticides, fertilisers rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, and advances in plant breeding and genetic technologies. In the last 15 years, however, many key crop yields have plateaued. Climate change, an ever-increasing human population, depletion of global rock-phosphorus and growing energy prices make current fertiliser production unsustainable and represent sizeable challenges to global food security. Many important crops form symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and this has motivated the development of novel approaches in crop breeding and agricultural practices to support and promote AMF in agroecosystems. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal symbiosis can be high beneficial in crops and wider agroecosystems in many ways, including improved soil structure and resistance to pests. However, AMF colonisation does not necessarily translate directly into enhanced plant performance or crop yield, while land management practices that would encourage mycorrhiza\textendash crop associations, such as low-till or minimal chemical input often incur yield-reducing trade-offs. Synthesis. We draw on ecological knowledge of AMF to inform their role in agroecosystems, providing a balanced look at mycorrhiza\textendash crop symbioses in terms of plant ecophysiology and the wider role of AMF in agroecosystems and ask the question: are AMF our sustainable saviours?},

In this review we explore whether fungi that respond differently to N deposition also differ in functional traits, including organic N use, hydrophobicity and exploration type (extent and pattern of extraradical hyphae). Cortinarius, Tricholoma, Piloderma, and Suillus had the strongest evidence of consistent negative effects of N deposition. Cortinarius, Tricholoma and Piloderma display consistent protein use and produce medium-distance fringe exploration types with hydrophobic mycorrhizas and rhizomorphs. Genera that produce long-distance exploration types (mostly Boletales) and contact short-distance exploration types (e.g., Russulaceae, Thelephoraceae, some athelioid genera) vary in sensitivity to N deposition. Members of Bankeraceae have declined in Europe but their enzymatic activity and belowground occurrence are largely unknown. Bankeraceae produce a distinct hydrophobic mat exploration type that may also be important in N acquisition under conditions of low N availability. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

Nevertheless, the functional significance of this metric remains controversial. In this review, I discuss whether manipulations of PRLC generally led to changes in plant biomass and P content, and whether AMF taxa and plant functional groups influence these relationships.},

Although substantial amounts of resources are exchanged, the factors that regulate trade in the AM symbiosis are poorly understood. Recent evidence for the reciprocally regulated exchange of resources by AM fungi and plants has led to the suggestion that these symbioses operate according to biological market dynamics, in which interactions are viewed from an economic perspective, and the most beneficial partners are favoured. Here we present five arguments that challenge the importance of reciprocally regulated exchange, and thereby market dynamics, for resource exchange in the AM symbiosis, and suggest that such reciprocity is only found in a subset of symbionts, under specific conditions. We instead propose that resource exchange in the AM symbiosis is determined by competition for surplus resources, functional diversity and sink strength.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhiza is a mutually beneficial biological association between species in the fungal phylum Glomeromycota and higher plants roots. The symbiosis is thought to have afforded green plants the opportunity to invade dry land ca 450 Ma ago and the vast majority of extant terrestrial plants retain this association. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi perform various ecological functions in exchange for host photosynthetic carbon that almost always contribute to the fitness of hosts from an individual to community level. Recent AM fungal research, increasingly delving into the `Black Box', suggests that species in this phylum may play a key facilitative role in below-ground micro- and meso-organism community dynamics, even more perhaps, that of a bioengineer. The ubiquitous nature of the symbiosis in extant flora and the fact that variations from the AM symbiosis are recent events suggest that Glomeromycota and plant roots coevolved. This review considers aspects of AM fungal ecology emphasizing past and present importance of the phylum in niche to global ecosystem function. Nutrient exchange, evolution, taxonomy, phenology, below-ground microbial interaction, propagule dissemination, invasive plants interactions, the potential role in phytoremediation and some of the factors affecting AM fungal biology are discussed. We conclude that it is essential to include AM association in any study of higher plants in natural environments in order to provide an holistic understanding of ecosystems.},

In this review article, we outline the current concepts of nutrient exchanges within this symbiosis (mechanisms and regulation). First, we focus on phosphorus and nitrogen transfer from the fungal partner to the host plant, and on the reciprocal transfer of carbon compounds, with a highlight on a possible interplay between nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition during AM symbiosis. We further discuss potential mechanisms of regulation of these nutrient exchanges linked to membrane dynamics. The review finally addresses the common mycorrhizal networks formed AMF, which interconnect plants from similar and/or different species. Finally the best way to integrate this knowledge and the ensuing potential benefits of AM into sustainable agriculture is discussed.},
