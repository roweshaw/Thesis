## Abstract
Review 983 most plant species. According to [^Brundrett_2018_a]), 72% of vascular plants are arbuscular mycorrhizal (where Glomeromycotina fungi form inter-/intracellular hyphal networks within the roots), 2.0% are ectomycorrhizal (where fungi of the Ascomycota or Basidiomycota produce a mantle surrounding the root tip as well as an intercellular hyphal network between the root epidermal and cortical cells), 1.5% are ericoid mycorrhizal (where mostly Ascomycota form coils inside the epidermal cells of the thin roots of Ericales) and 10% are orchid mycorrhizal (where mostly Basidiomycota colonize the cortical cells of orchid protocorms and roots). Just 8% of plants are completely nonmycorrhizal, and 7% have inconsistent nonmycorrhizal–arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. The State of the World’s Plants report ([^Willis_2017_a]) lists ==about 391 000 species of vascular plants currently known to science==; therefore, ==we can conclude that the number of mycorrhizal plant species ranges from== 320 000 to 340 000, also taking into account that many nonvascular plants, like liverworts, interact with mycorrhizal fungi. All these plants associate with more than 50 000 fungal species ([^van_der_Heijden_et+al_2015_a]) and appear equally successful in colonizing different environments, from alpine and boreal zones to tropical forests and grasslands.

## Key points
- The aim of this review is to draw up a map of the ideas that changed mycorrhizal research, searching for topics that were central in the 19th century, became seminal in revealing the biological meaning of mycorrhizal associations along the decades, and are still crucial today in the ‘omics’ era
- Ó 2018 The Author New Phytologist Ó 2018 New Phytologist Trust other scientific fields, the most recent molecular studies of mycorrhizal biology were developed on the shoulders of work by researchers in the past
- Thanks to a protocol that allowed him to produce ectomycorrhizal symbioses under sterile conditions, he examined the competition for available nitrogen between soil microorganisms and plant roots and suggested that ectomycorrhizal fungi primarily facilitate nitrogen uptake
- The discovery that GR24 treatment led to an increase in the release of chitin oligomers ([^Genre_et+al_2013_a]) by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and, subsequently, to amplification of the calcium spiking response, offered the first experimental evidence of the interaction between the signalling molecules released by the fungal and plant partners ([^Bonfante_2015_a])
- In the absence of molecular data, ultrastructural observations have allowed researchers to look beyond the hedge: the deep reorganization of the cortical cells following the fungal colonization suggested a reprogramming of the molecular plant machinery that has been largely confirmed by RNA-sequencing studies in all the mycorrhizal symbioses ([^Veneault-Fourrey_et+al_2014_a]; [^Fiorilli_et+al_2015_a]; [^Peter_et+al_2016_a]; [^Fochi_et+al_2017_a]; [^Sugimura_2017_a]; [^Martino_et+al_2018_a])

## Synopsis

### Signalling: a central question of our time?
One of the major questions of the community studying plant– microbe interactions is the nature of the signals exchanged between the partners and how they are perceived. [^Oliveira_et+al_2018_a]) compiled an exhaustive list of the molecules so far identified as involved in plant–microbe interactions.
The pregerminated spores were stimulated by exudates diffusing from the growing roots in the absence of any physical contact (Fig. 4) The stimulation of hyphal branching was impressive
These observations were nicely confirmed by the group of Manuela Giovannetti in Pisa ([^Giovannetti_et+al_1993_a]), only many years later did other studies identify the plant bioactive molecules that stimulate the branching and metabolism of presymbiotic hyphae in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as strigolactones ([^Akiyama_et+al_2005_a]; [^Besserer_et+al_2006_a]).
The discovery that GR24 treatment led to an increase in the release of chitin oligomers ([^Genre_et+al_2013_a]</a>) by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and, subsequently, to amplification of the calcium spiking response, offered the first experimental evidence of the interaction between the signalling molecules released by the fungal and plant partners ([^Bonfante_2015_a]).
Looking at the fungal factors, chitin-related molecules seem to be shared by pathogenic and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, opening the question of whether they could function in signalling in ectomycorrhizal symbioses

### The colonization process: how cellular studies predicted future ‘omics’ data
If the authors stop to look at the old drawings by G.
At the 1974 Leeds meeting, the different types of interfaces originating during the interaction between Ornithogalum umbellatum and its endogenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were carefully described and listed
They were assigned different numbers: the plant cell wall–fungal wall contact was named IT8, and at the moment of fungal penetration and plant membrane invagination the interface was named IT24.
In the absence of molecular data, ultrastructural observations have allowed researchers to look beyond the hedge: the deep reorganization of the cortical cells following the fungal colonization suggested a reprogramming of the molecular plant machinery that has been largely confirmed by RNA-sequencing studies in all the mycorrhizal symbioses ([^Veneault-Fourrey_et+al_2014_a]; [^Fiorilli_et+al_2015_a]; [^Peter_et+al_2016_a]; [^Fochi_et+al_2017_a]; [^Sugimura_2017_a]; [^Martino_et+al_2018_a]).
Dictyosome Microtubules molecules from minerals to organic compounds), as well as the events that allow new membrane biogenesis, and the regulatory machinery, already belong to the molecular era of mycorrhizal research, as summarized in many recent reviews ([^Mclean_et+al_2017_a]; [^Lanfranco_et+al_2018_a]; [^Pimprikar_2018_a])

### The genetics underlying colonization events
At the end of the 1980s the authors already had a good deal of knowledge of mycorrhizal morphology, but a crucial bit was missing: the genetic control that plants exert on entry by the fungus
This important discovery was made in Dijon, when the plant geneticist Gerard Duc, collaborating with two ‘mycorrhizal’ colleagues, Vivienne Gianinazzi-Pearson and Silvio Gianinazzi, discovered that mutant plants that were not successful in producing active nodules were resistant to mycorrhiza formation.
The authors have learned that many genes control the signalling/early phase, whereas others are directly related to mycorrhizal functioning
Most of these mutants share a similar phenotype: the arbuscules are stunted and not fully developed, suggesting that plant genetic determinants control arbuscule morphology ([^Gutjahr_2013_a]).
Tailoring the interactions of crop plants and their associated microbiota may provide a crucial advance for sustainable agriculture

### Concluding thoughts: chance and needs in mycorrhizal symbioses
A walk through mycorrhizal research from the middle of the 1800s to today reveals that many of the crucial questions the authors are facing were first asked many years ago.
[^Mosse_1970_a]) described the presence of bacteria-like organisms inside the spores of F. mosseae; some years later the author observed similar organisms the first time that the author looked at a mycorrhizal section under the electron microscope ([^Bonfante_2014_a]), but the invention of PCR was needed for successful naming of these organisms ([^Bianciotto_et+al_1996_a]; [^Bonfante_2017_a])
This is a great time for the mycorrhizal scientific community, because of the powerful tools that are available, and because of a crucial change in the perception of mycorrhizal symbiosis.
In looking to the future of mycorrhizal studies, the authors can learn much by examining their roots in the past – and the author looks forward to future developments in the understanding of these remarkable biological systems


## Study subjects

### 983 most plant species
- . ==Review 983 most plant species==. According to [^Brundrett_2018_a]), 72% of vascular plants are arbuscular mycorrhizal (where Glomeromycotina fungi form inter-/intracellular hyphal networks within the roots), 2.0% are ectomycorrhizal (where fungi of the Ascomycota or Basidiomycota produce a mantle surrounding the root tip as well as an intercellular hyphal network between the root epidermal and cortical cells), 1.5% are ericoid mycorrhizal (where mostly Ascomycota form coils inside the epidermal cells of the thin roots of Ericales) and 10% are orchid mycorrhizal (where mostly Basidiomycota colonize the cortical cells of orchid protocorms and roots)

### 391000 species
- Just 8% of plants are completely nonmycorrhizal, and 7% have inconsistent nonmycorrhizal–arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. ==The State of the World’s Plants report ([^Willis_2017_a]) lists about 391 000 species of vascular plants currently known to science; therefore, we can conclude that the number of mycorrhizal plant species ranges from 320 000 to 340 000, also taking into account that many nonvascular plants, like liverworts, interact with mycorrhizal fungi==. All these plants associate with more than 50 000 fungal species ([^van_der_Heijden_et+al_2015_a]) and appear equally successful in colonizing different environments, from alpine and boreal zones to tropical forests and grasslands

### 50000 fungal species
- The State of the World’s Plants report ([^Willis_2017_a]) lists about 391 000 species of vascular plants currently known to science; therefore, we can conclude that the number of mycorrhizal plant species ranges from 320 000 to 340 000, also taking into account that many nonvascular plants, like liverworts, interact with mycorrhizal fungi. ==All these plants associate with more than 50 000 fungal species ([^van_der_Heijden_et+al_2015_a]) and appear equally successful in colonizing different environments, from alpine and boreal zones to tropical forests and grasslands==. 

## Data analysis
- #method/pearson

## Findings
- Just 8% of plants are completely nonmycorrhizal, and 7% have inconsistent nonmycorrhizal–arbuscular mycorrhizal associations

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- Thanks to the sequencing of new genomes, their study clearly indicated that Mucoromycota constitutes a phylum with three subphyla: Mucoromycotina, Mortierellomycotina, and Glomeromycotina; at least until today, this study unambiguously defines the phylogenetic position of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. ==It is true that our arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are now relegated from phylum status to a lower subphylum level==, but many shared phenotypic features among the three subphyla (e.g. the presence of endobacteria; [^Bonfante_2017_a]) have provided a good rationale for explaining similarities (hyphal morphology) and dissimilarities (nutritional styles) among these enigmatic fungi
- Despite the emerging understanding of the role of strigolactones, the molecular mechanisms underlying the hyphal branching of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, first observed by [^Hepper_1975_a]), remain poorly known ([^Lanfranco_et+al_2018_b]). Data from RNA sequencing of germinated spores of Gigaspora margarita after a treatment with the synthetic strigolactone analogue GR24 ==confirmed the findings of== [^Besserer_et+al_2006_a], [^Besserer_et+al_2008_a]), revealing the upregulated expression of mitochondrial genes ([^Salvioli_et+al_2016_a]) as well as of some genes related to cell wall components (encoding chitin deacetylase, chitin synthase)
- Gallaud or B. ==Peyronel and compare them with the beautiful schemes of ectomycorrhizas in the publications by [^Martin_et+al_2016_a]), or with the iconic arbuscules shown by [^Brundrett_et+al_1984_a]) or by Maria Harrison’s group ([^Bravo_et+al_2017_a]), we will have no doubt of the beauty and richness of the details in the recent publications==
- However, many basic points of information (i.e. fungal structure, host anatomy and plant cell specificity) were already correctly identified at the dawn of research on mycorrhizas. The finding that fossils of the Rhynie Chert host fungal structures ==similar to modern arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi reflects the excellent knowledge of our colleagues of the past== ([^Kidston_1921_a])

## Contributions
- We can conclude this endless tale by claiming that almost 100 years ago (1923) Beniamino Peyronel, who looked at the coenocytic hyphae running between mycorrhizal roots and the spores of Endogone-like fungi, was not so far from our current views.
