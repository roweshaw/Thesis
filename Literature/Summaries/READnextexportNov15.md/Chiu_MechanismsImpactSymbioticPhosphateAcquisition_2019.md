## Abstract
Phosphorous is important for life but often limiting for plants. The symbiotic pathway of phosphate uptake via arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is evolutionarily ancient and today occurs in natural and agricultural ecosystems alike. Plants capable of this symbiosis can obtain up to all of the phosphate from symbiotic fungi, and this offers potential means to develop crops less dependent on unsustainable P fertilizers. Here, we review the mechanisms and insights gleaned from the fine-tuned signal exchanges that orchestrate the intimate mutualistic symbiosis between plants and AMF. As the currency of trade, nutrients have signaling functions beyond being the nutritional goal of mutualism. ==We propose that such signaling roles and metabolic reprogramming may represent commitments for a mutualistic symbiosis that act across the stages of symbiosis development==.

## Key points
- Phosphorous is crucial for life by virtue of its unique chemistry
- This suggests that the Ca2+-oscillation machinery is not affected, but does not rule out Pi-suppression of presymbiotic signals leading to hyphopodia formation, or of the transcriptional activation to accommodate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) downstream of Ca2+ oscillations
- The symbiosis between plants and AMF is one of the many symbioses, but it is remarkable for its widespread occurrence, evolutionary success, and our level of mechanistic understanding
- On top of long-term evolutionary dynamics, the signaling processes required for successful symbiosis establishment appear to involve nutrient dependency at all stages (Fig. 3)
- Presymbiotic signaling itself induces transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming in hosts, increasing C flux and C sink strength
- Understanding how plants, AMF, as well as the AMF-associated microbiome engage in the symbiotic nutrient trade strategies maintained over millions of years will, importantly, help provide solutions for the phosphate challenge modern agriculture faces

## Synopsis
Phosphorous is crucial for life by virtue of its unique chemistry. Phosphate is capable of chemical bonds that confer remarkable stability but at the same time facile manipulation ([^Westheimer_1987_a]</a>).
It was recently demonstrated that C delivered from the plant to fungus is delivered as fructose to the bacteria, which acts as a nutrient and signal for the latter to secrete acid phosphatases to solubilize Po for uptake by AMF (Fig. 2).
Ospt13 mutants, despite having reduced colonization and stunted arbuscule development, have wild-type levels of OsPT11 transcripts and symbiotic Pi uptake ([^Yang_et+al_2012_a]</a>).
The pervasive role of GRAS domain TFs (Fig. 1), especially in the case of DELLA proteins, could provide a means for plants to integrate growth, developmental, and nutritional signals via phytohormones with arbuscule development.
In addition to the increasingly complex transcriptional network and nutrient exchange during arbuscule development, recent work characterizing the proteome and transcriptome of mycorrhizal roots and arbusculated cells, respectively, demonstrated for the first time existence of signaling cascades mediated by receptor-like kinases (RLKs) at the PAM ([^Roth_et+al_2018_a]).
Mutants of symbiotic PTs (MtPT4, OsPT11, OsPT13), genes involved in lipid biosynthesis/delivery (OsSTR1,2, MtSTR1,2, LjFatM, DIS, RAM2), as well as H+ATPases powering nutrient transfer all result in disrupted nutrient transfer, reduced colonization, stunted arbuscule development, altered arbuscule morphology, and in the case of mtpt4/ ospt11 mutants, increased arbuscule turnover ([^Javot_et+al_2007_a]; [^Yang_et+al_2012_a]</a>; [^Xie_et+al_2013_a]; [^Krajinski_et+al_2014_a]; [^Wang_et+al_2014_a]; [^Bravo_et+al_2016_a], [^Bravo_et+al_2017_a]; [^Keymer_et+al_2017_a]; [^Brands_et+al_2018_a]).
Experiments such as those in [^Sawers_et+al_2017_a]), [^Watts-Williams_et+al_2018_a]), and [^Zhang_et+al_2018_a]) suggest that plant genetics, fungal genotypes, and associated bacteria together determine mycorrhizal benefit derived from symbiosis, forming the basis for complex crop-breeding programs in the future.
Possible roles of endobacteria have been proposed to include nutrient transfer to and activating metabolic reprograming of AMF to increase success of colonizing host plants ([^Lumini_et+al_2007_a]; [^Salvioli_et+al_2016_a]; [^Vannini_et+al_2016_a]; [^Venice_et+al_2017_a]; [^Dearth_et+al_2018_a]), as well as transkingdom gene transfer for putative effector-like proteins with an extended phenotype on the plant ([^Torres-Cortés_et+al_2015_a]).
PSR promotes AMF colonization, but symbiotic Pi exchange and subsequent mobilization to the shoot could relieve the PSR and activate defense gene expression to terminate symbiosis.
AMF colonization steadily increases in wildtype plants, suggesting that symbiosis signaling down-regulates certain aspects of the PSR to favor fungal accommodation over exclusionary defense.
Understanding how plants, AMF, as well as the AMF-associated microbiome engage in the symbiotic nutrient trade strategies maintained over millions of years will, importantly, help provide solutions for the phosphate challenge modern agriculture faces


## Study subjects

### 8 genes
- Reproductive stage; Fe/ROS imbalance. ==Strains containing an increased copy number of eight genes (Octomom) drastically reduced host life span==. Amplified Octomom genes on Palaeozoic palaeosols alongside with AMF profoundly shaped terrestrial landscapes and, today, AM symbiosis remain an important aspect of global biogeochemical cycles ([^Retallack_1997_a]; [^Raven_2001_a]; [^Brundrett_2002_a]; [^Hetherington_2018_a]; [^Mills_et+al_2018_a])

### 150000 genes
- Large-scale sequencing approaches have since revealed some insight into how diversity can be generated in spite of an apparent asexual lifestyle. ==First, AMF possess massive intraspecific genotypic variation, with the common laboratory strain R. irregularis alone possessing a pangenome of 150,000 genes and likely, as a result, considerable phenotypic variation even in a morphologically defined species ([^Mathieu_et+al_2018_a])==. In addition, singlenucleus sequencing of AMF revealed that genetic diversity can be generated via internuclear recombination in a dikaryotic stage (two distinct mating loci) ([^Chen_et+al_2018_a])

## Data analysis
- #method/pearson

## Findings
- Up to 22% of the photosynthetically fixed carbon is traded for symbiotic Pi, which could supply all (100%) of plant phosphate uptake ([^Jakobsen_1990_a]; Smith et al 2003, 2011; [^Yang_et+al_2012_a]; [^Bravo_et+al_2017_a]; [^Jiang_et+al_2017_a]; [^Keymer_et+al_2017_a]; [^Luginbuehl_2017_a]; [^Roth_2017_a])
- In rice, AMF contributes up to 70% of the P acquired by the plant ([^Yang_et+al_2012_a])

## Counterpoint to earlier claims
- The remobilization of vacuolar Pi stores, best understood in non-AM hosts Arabidopsis, is important for Pi homeostasis, and recent work have identified vacuolar Pi transporters (VPTs; also PHT5 family members) that possess both SYG1/PHO81/ XPR1 (SPX) and major facilitator family (MFS) domains, to primarily mediate vacuolar influx ([^Liu_et+al_2016_b]; [^Xu_et+al_2019_a]</a></a>). ==Although the role of SPX-MFS3 in mediating vacuolar Pi efflux in rice is contested== ([^Wang_et+al_2015_a]; [^Xu_et+al_2019_a]</a></a>), a recent study revealed that intriguingly, an ancestral plasma membrane-localized glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (GlpT; at least in Escherichia coli) is instead directed to the plant tonoplast and mediates vacuolar Pi efflux in rice, Marchantia polymorpha and P. patens ([^Xu_et+al_2019_a]</a></a>)

## Contributions
- Perspective: The Paradox of Phosphate Starvation during AM Symbiosis<br/><br/>Phosphate not only regulates local arbuscule development; it also has well-known systemic regulatory roles in symbiosis signaling. AM colonization is repressed under high Pi supply ([^Mosse_1973_a]; [^Branscheid_et+al_2010_a]</a></a>; [^Balzergue_et+al_2011_a]</a></a>, [^Balzergue_et+al_2013_a]; [^Kobae_et+al_2016_a]) and infection attempts in maize roots were found to be inversely proportional to shoot Pi status ([^Braunberger_et+al_1991_a]). This regulation is systemic, as split-root experiments demonstrated that high Pi on one side suppressed AM symbiosis globally ([^Branscheid_et+al_2010_a]</a></a>; [^Breuillin_et+al_2010_a]</a>; [^Balzergue_et+al_2011_a]</a></a>). The root-to-shoot signal remains elusive. Overexpression of miR399, members of which are well-described systemic Pi-starvation signals, failed to restore AM colonization under high Pi levels ([^Branscheid_et+al_2010_a]</a></a>). In addition, high phosphate suppresses SL biosynthesis, which attenuates the level of plant-to-fungus signal during presymbiotic signaling. Nevertheless, the exogenous application of a synthetic SL, GR24, failed to restore AM colonization at high Pi levels ([^Breuillin_et+al_2010_a]</a>; [^Balzergue_et+al_2011_a]</a></a>), indicating that reduced SLs in the rhizosphere is insufficient to explain the suppressive effect. However, perinuclear Ca2+-oscillations were still generated in response to AMF hyphopodia under high Pi levels ([^Balzergue_et+al_2013_a]). This suggests that the Ca2+-oscillation machinery is not affected, but does not rule out Pi-suppression of presymbiotic signals leading to hyphopodia formation, or of the transcriptional activation to accommodate AMF downstream of Ca2+ oscillations. Finally, we also cannot rule out intrinsic inhibitory responses of AMF under high Pi. How AMF sense and respond to high Pi and subsequent root colonization dynamics is also relatively unclear. Evidence so far suggest that high Pi treatment may decrease expression of secreted AMF proteins, including STRIGOLACTONE-INDUCED SECRETED PROTEIN1 (SIS1) that positively regulates AMF colonization; as well as cell-cycle regulatory genes, DNA replication, and mitosis-related genes in the IRM but not ERM extraradical mycelium ([^Kikuchi_et+al_2014_a]; [^Tsuzuki_et+al_2016_a]; [^Sugimura_2017_a]). It is, however, a challenge to uncouple intrinsic AMF responses from plant/exudatemediated responses in a plant-AMF coculture system.

## Future work
- Following arbuscule senescence, vesicles often emerge as lipid storage bodies and could be crucial for subsequent rounds of infection affected in ark1 mutants ([^Roth_et+al_2018_a]). Whereas the formation of vesicles and daughter spores in AMF reflects fungal fitness, the dearth of knowledge on the mechanisms specifying and underlying these processes invite further studies.

[^Nutrients_2000_a]: Nutrients exchanged at the symbiotic interface, regardless of their direction, identity, precursor, and subsequent assimilation pathways, traverse the same cell membranes. Because the membrane potential is negative inside relative to the outside, both parties require cation/proton channels to power the transport of neutral and negatively charged molecules across membranes. Accordingly, the periarbuscular space has been described as an acidic compartment, and H+-ATPases were proposed to provide the proton gradient and electrochemical energy (Gianinazzi-Pearson et al. 2000; Guttenberger 2000; Ferrol et al. 2002; Krajinski et al. 2002; Ramos et al. 2009). Indeed, H+-ATPases have since been demonstrated to be necessary for transport of phosphate, arbuscule development, and fungal colonization in both Medicago and rice (Krajinski et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014).

[^Neofunctionalization_2005_a]: Neofunctionalization of symbiotic phosphate transporters for asymbiotic roles is also observed in certain plant families or species, and may have thus conferred additional tools for the plant P transport and allocation over evolutionary time. Gene duplication in the Solanaceae gave rise to two orthologs of OsPT11 in tomato and potato (SlPT4/LePT4 and SlPT5/ LePT5) (Nagy et al. 2005; Poulsen et al. 2005). LePT4 is exclusively expressed during symbiosis, but it is dispensable for symbiotic P uptake; whereas LePT5 is also expressed during asymbiosis and is induced >10-fold during fruit ripening (Xu et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2014). These examples suggest that gene duplications can give rise to new regulation and functions in P partitioning. Similarly, OsPT11/MtPT4 orthologs in maize (ZmPT6) and Brachypodium (BdPT7) accumulate in both mycorrhizal roots and also noncolonized roots and leaves of Pi-starved plants (Nagy et al. 2006; Hong et al. 2012).

[^One_2014_a]: One neglected aspect of symbiotic and asymbiotic Pi uptake is the relative contributions of various root types to the overall uptake and assimilation of Pi. Changes in root architecture is one of the common physiological responses investigated in asymbiotic nutrient signaling pathways. In non-AM A. thaliana, primary root growth is arrested and lateral root density (LRD) increases (Péret et al. 2014) during Pi starvation. In monocots where genetic architecture of root development is different, changes to the primary embryonic roots of seedling roots are subtle, whereas LRD decreased in maize but increased in rice (Péret et al. 2014; Hochholdinger et al. 2018). More importantly, lateral rooting correlates positively with Pi acquisition under low P conditions (Zhu and Lynch 2004; Gamuyao et al. 2012; Vejchasarn et al. 2016). Where and how phosphate transporters are expressed in different root types, and contribute to Pi uptake, remain to be fully characterized.

[^AM_2005_b]: AM symbiosis, meanwhile, increases LRD in the leguminous and monocot hosts examined thus far (Oláh et al. 2005; Gutjahr et al. 2009; Maillet et al. 2011; Mukherjee and Ané 2011; Chiu et al. 2018). With AMF preferentially colonizing LRs in both monocots and dicots, this effectively increases the symbiotic interface for nutrient exchange (Gutjahr et al. 2009). Colonization by AMF elicited a fundamental reprogramming of the rice crown root transcriptome, whereby the profiles of secondary cell wall metabolism, hormone, and transport-related genes indicated a switch in functional relationships of root types upon entering symbiosis (Gutjahr et al. 2015). To this end, better physiological characterization of contributions of the various root types to symbiotic Pi uptake will help define an “ideal” root architecture for crop-breeding programs.

[^Recently_2018_a]: Recently, two independent groups working on different leguminous species identified and functionally characterized WRINKLED1-like AP2 TFs that work downstream of RAM1. CTTC MOTIF-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (LjCBX1) and Medicago WRINKLED5a (MtWRI5a) (Jiang et al. 2018; Xue et al. 2018) are TFs that bind to the AW-box motif and regulate the expression of fatty-acid biosynthesis genes, phosphate transporters (MtPT4/LjPT4), as well as H+-ATPases, suggesting the existence of a transcriptional network directly regulating bidirectional nutrient exchange (Jiang et al. 2018; Xue et al. 2018). With the plethora of actors identified in the plant host, we look forward to the identification of the fungal counterparts.

[^Interestingly_2011_a]: Interestingly, in the case of Medicago pt4, the mutant phenotype is rescued by nitrogen deprivation, in a manner dependent on an ammonium transporter, MtAMT2-3 (Javot et al. 2011; Breuillin-Sessoms et al. 2015). As MtAMT2-3 is unable to complement a yeast ammonium transport mutant, it has since been suggested to have a signaling role in arbuscule maintenance—possibly in a similar fashion to OsPT13 (Yang et al. 2012; Breuillin-Sessoms et al. 2015). Screening for the suppression of the mtpt4 phenotype revealed the role of MYB1, a MYB-like TF that regulates arbuscule degeneration. The requirement of a MYB1-DELLA-NSP1 complex to degenerate arbuscules lends further support to the theme that GRAS-domain protein complexes have temporal and combinatorial control of arbuscule development (Floss et al. 2017).

[^Given_1988_a]: Given the multitude of transport and regulatory activity occurring during symbiosis, the transient nature of arbuscules may appear enigmatic. Arbuscules have short life spans of ∼4–15 days before they mature and collapse, leaving the cortical cells competent for reinfection (Toth and Miller 1984; Alexander et al. 1988; Kobae and Hata 2010; Kobae and Fujiwara 2014). As such, in the same plant (and likewise fungus), symbiosis development is highly asynchronous, with new infection units co-occurring alongside fully developed arbuscules and senescing ones.

[^Meanwhile_2019_a]: Meanwhile, ultrastructural analyses of the periarbuscular space reveal the presence of interkingdom trafficking of extracellular vesicles (EVs) between the plant and AMF (Ivanov et al. 2019; Roth et al. 2019), which invites speculation on the cargo constituents in these EVs. In Prochlorococcus, EVs carry organic carbon and nucleic acids with importance in nutrient fluxes in marine ecosystems (Biller et al. 2014). In Paracoccus, EVs carry hydrophobic N-acylhomoserine lactones for quorum sensing (Toyofuku et al. 2017). In a plethora of human organs, EVs are capable of regulating local and global metabolism and associated cellular processes (Iraci et al. 2016, 2017). In AMF symbiosis, could these EVs be involved in signaling and potential nutrient exchange as well?

[^Looking_2016_a]: Looking forward, significant benefits of symbiotic Pi delivery can be harnessed, considering that modern industrial agricultural practices including the intensive use of fertilizers, fungicides, long fallow periods, and tilling have diminished the contribution of symbiotic Pi to crop nutrition (Sawers et al. 2008, 2018; PérezJaramillo et al. 2016). The nonrenewable and politically tenuous nature of mined rock phosphates as well as pollutive impact of intense fertilizer application in industrial agriculture have led to the growing awareness and drive for more sustainable alternative mechanisms to improve crop P acquisition and P use efficiency (Cordell et al. 2009; Carpenter and Bennett 2011; Elser and Bennett 2011; Steffen et al. 2015).

[^In_2004_a]: In a mycorrhizal network, one plant can be colonized by multiple AMF species at once, and each AMF species can infect multiple hosts of the same or different plant species (Giovannetti et al. 2004). This has lent the symbiosis to many imaginative metaphors (e.g., “wood-wide web”; underground economy, etc.). Indeed, trade of commodities (nutrients) between multiple actors with different comparative advantages (in harnessing phosphate versus reduced carbon) invites analyses via the biological market theory and other models that allow hypotheses on resource exchange in different contexts to be formulated and tested (Noë and Hammerstein 1995; Kiers et al. 2003; Werner et al. 2014; Walder and van der Heijden 2015; Noë and Kiers 2018). Given the benefits of “cheating” in mutualism, does the plant and fungus select for a more cooperative partner (West et al. 2007; Kiers and Denison 2008)?

[^And_2009_a]: Several experiments suggest that a discrimination mechanism for reciprocal exchange exists—plants provided more C to fungal species that delivered more Pi (Bever et al. 2009; Kiers et al. 2011) and, likewise, AMF species provided more N/Pi to unshaded plants that likely delivered more C (Fellbaum et al. 2014). Collectively, these mechanisms might drive the amplification of size inequality in a network (Merrild et al. 2013; Weremijewicz and Janos 2013; Weremijewicz et al. 2016). However, in contrast to these observations, flax derived more nutrients than sorghum despite contributing less into the mycorrhizal network (Walder et al. 2012). Nevertheless, direct comparisons may be difficult, as the relative costs of C for a C4 plant (sorghum) may be different from that of a C3 plant (flax).

[^Overall_2006_a]: Overall, it appears that preferential resource allocation is able to drive evolution of mutualism even when the costs are immense, whereas coexistence of an exploitative partner is possible as a negative feedback in the long run in a mixed colonization situation (Foster and Kokko 2006; Steidinger and Bever 2016). These conclusions may help explain the diversity of plant-AMF interaction outcomes, as well as the evolutionary emergence of mycoheterotrophs that epitomize exploitative plant partners. Ultimately, symbiotic nutrient exchange occurs between a kingdom of plants and a subdivision of Glomeromycotina fungi, notwithstanding other symbioses. The diversity in trade terms is therefore not unexpected, and remains to be characterized across many other combinations and hierarchies with modeling tools.

[^In_2016_b]: In addition, recent work on biotic interactions in the non-AM host Arabidopsis illustrates that the continuity from mutualism to parasitism along the symbiosis spectrum (Box 1) can shift with phosphate availability and phosphate starvation signaling. For one, C. toefieldiae acts as a Pi-delivering endophyte without causing disease only under Pi limitation. When Pi is abundant, plant defense genes are induced and growth-promoting benefits of the endophyte are abolished (Hiruma et al. 2016).
