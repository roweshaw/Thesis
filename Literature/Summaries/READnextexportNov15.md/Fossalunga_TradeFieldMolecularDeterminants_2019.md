## Abstract
Traditionally, the most popular sentences used to describe the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis sound like: “AM fungi form one of the most widespread root symbioses, associating with 80% of land plants. In this symbiosis, the fungus provides the plant host with mineral nutrients, especially phosphate, receiving in turn carbohydrates.” In the last years, the mycorrhiza research field has witnessed a big step forward in the knowledge of the physiology and the mechanisms governing this important symbiosis, that helped plants colonizing the lands more than 400 MYA. ==The huge expansion of the -omics studies produced the first results on the fungal side==, with genomes and transcriptomes of AM fungi being published. In parallel, ==the need for more sustainable agricultural practices has boosted the research in the field of the plant symbioses==, with the final aim of improving plant productivity employing symbiotic microbes as bioinoculants. Beside all the other (positive) effects that mycorrhizal fungi exert on plants, ==the nutrient exchange is considered as the keystone==, and the core mechanism governing this symbiosis. ==This review will focus on the molecular determinants underneath this exchange==, both on the fungal and the plant side. Coming ==back to the sentence that claims this symbiosis as based on phosphate provided to the plant== in return to carbohydrate, ==we will find that some concepts of this view still stand==, while some others have been partly revolutionized.

## Key points
- Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi belong to the basal fungal phylum of Glomeromycota [^1]
- The functional core of this symbiosis is represented by the arbuscule, a complex, highly branched structure formed by the fungus intracellularly, and surrounded by a plant membrane called periarbuscular membrane (PAM) [^3]
- Major recent breakthroughs in the AM biotrophy, as the discovery of the fungal dependency on host fatty acids, represented a real paradigm shift, and stimulated the researchers to construct an updated scenario of the plant–fungal exchanges to integrate the new findings. Both carbon and mineral nutrition in the AM symbiosis have been exhaustively reviewed by many Authors, the aim of this review is to provide the reader with a “handy guide” through the current view of the symbiotic transportome
- Sawers et al [^26] showed that the mycorrhizal outcome in terms of growth response of maize plants better correlates with the abundance of the extraradical mycelium than with the accumulation of the mycorrhiza-inducible phosphate transporter ZmPT6
- Volpe et al [^19] demonstrated that the expression of the mycorrhiza-inducible PT4 from M. truncatula and L. japonicus was not restricted to the PAM and present in the root tips of non-colonized plants
- In the plant-to-fungus direction, recent compelling results requested a real paradigm shift that shook up the mainstream bulk of knowledge: beside sugars, lipids are transferred from the plant to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and their transfer might represent the key of the fungal obligate biotrophy

## Synopsis
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi belong to the basal fungal phylum of Glomeromycota [^1]. They are obligate biotrophs that associate with plant roots forming the mycorrhiza.
Sawers et al [^26] showed that the mycorrhizal outcome in terms of growth response of maize plants better correlates with the abundance of the extraradical mycelium than with the accumulation of the mycorrhiza-inducible phosphate transporter ZmPT6.
Volpe et al [^19] demonstrated that the expression of the mycorrhiza-inducible PT4 from M. truncatula and L. japonicus was not restricted to the PAM and present in the root tips of non-colonized plants.
This fungal ability to take up and transfer N is mirrored by the presence of specific plant transporters: several AM-inducible ammonium transporters have been identified in different species such as Lotus japonicus, Glycine max, and Medicago truncatula.
Plants have different families of sucrose transporters (SUTs) that can be involved in the sugar transfer to the colonized roots: in M. truncatula, the expression profiles of MtSUTs are finely tuned by the presence of the fungal symbiont [^96], and the three sucrose transporters from tomato are up-regulated in roots colonized by Funneliformis mosseae [^97].
M. truncatula antisense lines for the biosynthetic enzyme sucrose synthase (MtSucS1) in roots displayed an abnormal mycorrhizal phenotype, with an impairment of plant growth under phosphate limitation, a reduced mycorrhization and relevant alterations in the morphology and life span of the arbuscules [^98].
Monosaccharides are the most likely sugar forms transferred to the fungal symbiont: consistently, plant monosaccharides transporters (MSTs) are finely regulated in roots upon mycorrhizal colonization [^99],[^100],[^101].
Some specific isoforms of the SUT and SWEET transporters showed expression patterns that nicely followed the plant C partitioning: the expression levels of MtSUT2 and MtSUT4‐1 positively correlated with the C allocation to the symbiotic partners, and MtSWEET12, MtSWEET15c, and MtSWEET15d were up-regulated in the mycorrhizal roots when the fungus had access to a N source, but were down‐regulated when the host plant was not under N starvation.
Some very recent researches well characterized at the molecular level the dynamics of such a fatty acid auxotrophy, and clarified that lipids are likely transferred from the plant host to the fungus at the symbiotic interface (Table 1).
The RAM1 transcription factor has been identified as an early regulator of the mycorrhiza-specific reprogramming, activating on the one hand genes involved in the transfer of FAs to the fungus [^121] and the AM-specific phosphate transporter PT4 on the other [^122].

## Findings
- In mycorrhizal plants, a considerable part (up to 70%) of the overall phosphate uptake can be acquired via the AM pathway [^13]
- Mycorrhizal colonization increases the root sink strength, with up to 20% of photosynthates transferred to the fungus [^92]

##  Builds on previous research
- Mycorrhizal plants exposed to high environmental heavy metal concentrations exhibited a wide spectrum of behaviors ranging from hyper accumulation to a reduction of the uptake, also including neutral responses (see Shi et al [^9] for a review). ==Early reports showed that zinc uptake in maize was positively affected by AM fungi==, with an increase of plant growth parameters [^75]

## Differs from previous work
- Taken together, these data strengthen the vision that the regulation of iron homeostasis might represent a relevant mechanism enabling AM fungi to cope with bacteria in the rhizosphere. Does the plant reward the fungus only with sugars? ==Early reports showed that sugars can be transported from the plant host to the fungus in the AM symbiosis== [^90], [^91] (Table 1)

## Contributions
- The nutrient exchange has surely been the more extensively studied aspect of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Yet, recent findings demonstrated that the scenario depicted in many years of research was far to be conclusive, and that much work is still needed to clarify the mechanics and the implications underneath this flow of nutrients. In particular, some important milestones have been recently placed:<br/><br/>• In the fungus-to-plant direction, the relevant role of the transfer of nutrients other than P and N has been brought to light, as well as the intricate network of connections that orchestrates the regulation of the nutrient exchange as a whole;<br/><br/>• In the plant-to-fungus direction, recent compelling results requested a real paradigm shift that shook up the mainstream bulk of knowledge: beside sugars, lipids are also transferred from the plant to AMFs, and their transfer might represent the key of the fungal obligate biotrophy.<br/><br/>The advancements made in the deciphering of this multifaceted scenario are extremely meaningful for the mycorrhiza scientific community. Nonetheless, they are also
