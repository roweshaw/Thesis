## Synopsis

### Nutrient transfer mechanisms between AMF and host plants in AM symbiosis
Improved mineral nutrition is considered as the main benefit of AM symbiosis, especially as regards phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) nutrition of mycorrhizal plants: these two essential macroelements are needed in large amounts by plants, and most plants constantly cope with low N and P concentrations in natural environments ([^Elser_et+al_2007_a]).
One-third of the root protein N could be provided by symbiotic AMF ([^Govindarajulu_et+al_2005_a])
This N uptake is mediated by various transport systems including transport of inorganic N in the forms of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3À), and of organic N in the forms of amino acids and peptides (Figs 1, 2).
It has been proposed that the relative availability of soil N and P determines whether or not mycorrhizal benefits outweigh their costs ([^Johnson_et+al_2015_a]</a>)
This trade-off model of compromise balance predicts that N fertilization only is of benefit when the plant is limited by P and there will be positive effects from providing C to the roots and the AMF.
Using petunia plants inoculated with R. irregularis, [^Nouri_et+al_2014_a]) found that only Pi and nitrate exerted a negative influence on AM root colonization, whereas other major plant nutrients such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfate and iron did not influence mycorrhizal development at elevated concentrations

### Symbiotic C transfer to the fungus
AMF provide their host plants greater access to soil nutrients and water that are not directly reachable by/ available to the host roots ([^Bago_et+al_2000_a]).
Experiments carried out on germinating spores of R. irregularis supplied evidence of a natural capacity to incorporate external glucose, but at very low concentrations
This transport was inhibited by high sugar concentrations, suggesting catabolic repression of the hexose transporter(s).
Spore germination and initial hyphal growth during the pre-symbiotic phase do not directly depend on the presence of host roots
These findings highlight the complexity of sugar partitioning in plant– microbe interactions (PMI) in general, especially in AM as regards the obligate biotrophy of AMF.
Investigations of the specific arbuscule-containing-cell transcriptome revealed no specific induction of potential sucrose transporter genes in this cell type, but increased promoter activity of putative sucrose and hexose transporter genes in cells adjacent to arbuscules or intercellular fungal hyphae ([^Gaude_et+al_2012_a]</a>)
This shows a role of SUTs in C partitioning rather than direct C supply to the fungus in mycorrhizal roots.
These findings suggest that depending on the Pi supply, the symbiont may be starved for plant lipid C

### Mycorrhizal benefits: a mutualism-to-parasitism continuum
Not all AMF are beneficial for the host ([^Johnson_et+al_1997_a]; [^Smith_2013_a]).
Plant DRMs have been characterized in several plants including tobacco, Medicago and Arabidopsis ([^Mongrand_et+al_2004_a]</a>; [^Borner_et+al_2005_a]</a>; [^Lefebvre_et+al_2007_a]</a></a>): in the main, structural phospholipids are not integrated in DRMs, except polyphosphoinositides ([^Furt_et+al_2010_a]), which were characterized as players of signal transduction or as controllers of ion transporters and channels functioning ([^Liu_et+al_2005_a]; [^Monteiro_et+al_2005_a])
This highlights a possible role of DRMs in signalling and/or regulation.
Concerning amino-acid transport in plants, to the knowledge only one lysine- and histidine-specific transporter (LHT) ([^Morel_et+al_2006_a]; [^Stanislas_et+al_2009_a]</a>) and two oligopeptide transporters (OPTs) ([^Stanislas_et+al_2009_a]</a>) have been reported as being present in plant DRMs

### Managing common mycorrhizal networks: a tool toward a sustainable agriculture
The AMF have nearly unrestricted host ranges and can associate with most plant species ([^Smith_2008_a]) (Fig. 4).
Annual plant species harbour higher AMF diversity than perennial plant species, and half of the currently identified AMF species are specific to one plant species ([^Torrecillas_et+al_2012_a]).
This suggests that the establishment of selected AMF communities in agricultural applications for enhanced crop productivity is no trivial issue.
The extraradical mycelium of one AMF or hyphal fusion of separate mycelia ([^Giovannetti_et+al_2004_a]; [^Mikkelsen_et+al_2008_a]</a></a>) can colonize and further connect neighbouring plants of the same or different species within a community to form common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) ([^Barto_et+al_2012_a]</a>).
CMNs can induce plant defence responses and plant communication through a variety of phytohormones such as jasmonic acid, methyl jasmonate and zeatin riboside ([^Song_et+al_2010_a]</a>) (Fig. 4)

### CMNs and plant–plant interactions
CMNs amplify intraspecific competition by altering the distribution of population size classes ([^Weremijewicz_2013_a]), a functional trait reflecting symmetrical or asymmetrical competition ([^Weiner_1986_a]</a>) between young and mature trees.
CMNs showed asymmetrical competition whereas plants with severed CMNs showed symmetrical competition ([^Weremijewicz_2013_a]</a>), suggesting that intact CMNs may supply nutrients such as N to large individuals that are highly photosynthetically active and provide the most C to their associated AMF ([^Merrild_et+al_2013_a]).
This reciprocal reward could depend on the rate of exchange of fungal mineral nutrients for host plant C ([^Kiers_et+al_2011_a]).
CMNs may provide faster mycorrhiza formation, limit the investment of seedlings in the construction costs of hyphal networks, give access to mineral nutrients and water, and could transfer C from one plant to another depending on the plant photosynthetic rates or the intensity of sources and sinks

### Plant–CMN–plant interplay and potential for crop pest control
Plant–plant signalling could be involved in food security by reducing pest-related crop losses (Fig. 4).
The CMN helps extend the bioactive zone of allelochemicals in the soil ([^Barto_et+al_2012_a]</a>) or changes leaf volatile organic chemicals ([^Babikova_et+al_2013_a]</a></a>).
CMNs represent a considerable potential for crop pest control through this belowground plant– plant signalling mechanism ([^Babikova_et+al_2014_a]).
Most cropped soils are tilled, which likely breaks up CMNs. Increasing tillage intensity decreases the mycorrhizal colonization of plants ([^Carpenter-Boggs_et+al_2003_a]; [^Lumini_et+al_2010_a]; [^Peyret-Guzzon_et+al_2016_a]; [^Sommermann_et+al_2018_a]).
Tillage may change the AMF community composition by positively selecting more tolerant AMF species and by impacting on the ability of CMNs to transfer defence signals ([^Brito_et+al_2012_a]; Brıgido et al, 2017).
All of these findings highlight the importance of CMNs and the imperative need for further research on their function and role, in the context of agroecological management

### AM fungi are not alone: interactions with PGPR
Apart from AMF, plants interact with further mutualistic root microorganisms such as plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), which can impact plant development and health (Fig. 1).
([^Benizri_et+al_2001_a]</a>), that can either be free or attached to the fungal mycelium ([^Bianciotto_et+al_2001_a]; [^van_Overbeek_2016_a])
They stimulate plant development through a variety of mechanisms, namely mobilization of rhizosphere-bound nutrients, fixation of atmospheric di-nitrogen, solubilization of P and synthesis of phytohormones such as IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid) ([^Kloepper_et+al_1980_a]; [^Glick_1995_a]).
A few fluorescent pseudomonads act as mycorrhiza-helper bacteria ([^Mugnier_1987_a]) by improving mycorrhizal root colonization ([^Gamalero_et+al_2010_a]</a>) and promoting the growth of extraradical hyphae, and by enhancing spore germination ([^Roesti_et+al_2005_a]).
AMF and PGPR are currently considered as essential actors in agronomic practices because they could help cut down chemical fertilizer and pesticide inputs, and promote the agriculture of the future, based on the implementation of practices that favour the ecosystem services rendered by beneficial microorganisms ([^Gianinazzi_et+al_2010_a])

### Conclusion and prospects
Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is the fruit of a long coevolution of AMF with their plant partners, in constant interaction with many other components of their environment; as such, it constitutes a major element of plant life, and of agroecological production.
Future progress will depend on the generalization of current knowledge to different Glomeromycota genera and species, through: (1) a deeper understanding of AM functioning; (2) the selection of AMF strains differing in their ability to provide ecosystem services; (3) the development of new AMF cocktails of synthetic communities covering the broadest possible range of ecosystem services; and (4) the development of technologies allowing AMF cultivation under controlled conditions
This progress will be a prelude to the development of a future ‘ecological engineering of AMF and their associated microorganisms’ and its integration into modern plant breeding while taking care of the ecosystem services rendered by these valuable fungi


## Study subjects

### 62 members
- Nitrate is taken up via an energy-dependent uptake process by specific, highly regulated transporters (Fig. 2) belonging to the huge nitrate and peptide transporter families – the NPF (NRT1/PTR family; [^Leran_et+al_2014_a]), NRT2 and NRT3 families ([^Orsel_et+al_2002_a]; [^Bai_et+al_2013_a]</a>). ==In plants, NPF is a large protein family (85, 79 and 62 members in rice, poplar and Arabidopsis, respectively) whose members transport either NO3À with low affinity or di-/tripeptides ([^Krouk_et+al_2010_a]), and also nitrite, glucosinolates or phytohormones ([^Bai_et+al_2013_a]</a>)==. In AMF, only one high-affinity transporter belonging to the NRT2 family has so far been described in R. irregularis (GiNT), and it was shown to be expressed in all AMF tissues (spores, extra and intraradical mycelium, arbuscules)

### 12 genes
- Hence, AMF are assumed to depend on host plants for de novo FA synthesis, another potential reason for the obligate biotrophy of these organisms. ==The FA auxotrophy of AMF is further supported by the fact that 12 genes related to lipid biosynthesis are exclusively present in the genomes of plants forming AM symbioses ([^Bravo_et+al_2016_a])==. Recent isotope labelling experiments clearly confirmed that R. irregularis cannot synthesize FAs de novo from carbohydrates ([^Jiang_et+al_2017_a]), which supports the obligate FA auxotrophy of AMF

##  Builds on previous research
- Nevertheless, only few reports are available about the effects of PGPR on strawberry. [^Vosatka_et+al_1992_a]) co-inoculated strawberry plants with AMF and Pseudomonas putida, and reported a synergistic effect on plant growth ([^Vosatka_et+al_1992_a]). The same authors highlighted a positive effect of Agrobacterium radiobacter on root colonization. [^Todeschini_et+al_2018_a]) ==recently reported an impact of PGPR and AMF co-inoculation on strawberry quality as well as the importance of the strains==

## Differs from previous work
- Although the influence of Pi availability on the plant proteins that direct lipid fluxes in arbuscules have not been investigated yet, the mycorrhiza-specific GPAT was found to belong to the genes expressed in all mycorrhiza fertilized with low phosphate, but not to the mycorrhiza of the low- or high-P control roots ([^Breuillin_et+al_2010_a]). ==Moreover==, the expression of STR and STR2, which mediate lipid fluxes into AMF, also was repressed by high Pi concentrations ([^Wang_et+al_2017_a],b)
- The similarity of animal proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport with plant members suggests that current knowledge concerning the lipid regulation of neurotransmitter transporters should help to decipher this topic in plants (e.g. [^Butchbach_et+al_2004_a]). Concerning amino-acid transport in plants, to ==our knowledge only one lysine- and histidine-specific transporter (LHT) ([^Morel_et+al_2006_a]; [^Stanislas_et+al_2009_a]</a>) and two oligopeptide transporters (OPTs) ([^Stanislas_et+al_2009_a]</a>) have been reported as being present in plant DRMs==

## Contributions
- <strong>Conclusion and prospects</strong><br/><br/>Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is the fruit of a long coevolution of AMF with their plant partners, in constant interaction with many other (abiotic and biotic) components of their environment; as such, it constitutes a major element not only of plant life, but also of agroecological production. The ecological services provided by AMF are truly broad, and suitable tools and/or markers have to be defined to phylogenetically characterize the OTUs and functionally define their contribution during the interaction. Moreover, quick and reliable tests for evaluating and monitoring their diversity and functionality in agroecosystems are still lacking.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the growing understanding of the mechanisms underlying AM symbiosis should not overshadow the fact that so far most results have been obtained on a small number of AM fungal species interacting with a small number of plant species. In particular, the R. irregularis model strain DAOM 197198, the first AMF whose genome was fully sequenced, is probably the most studied strain in research laboratories. Thus, our understanding of mycorrhizal biology is often limited to a few special cases, and any generalization of these concepts should be based on studies involving additional AMF species. Future progress will depend on the generalization of current knowledge to different Glomeromycota genera and species, through: (1) a deeper understanding of AM functioning; (2) the selection of AMF strains differing in their ability to provide ecosystem services; (3) the development of new AMF cocktails of synthetic communities covering the broadest possible range of ecosystem services; and (4) the development of technologies allowing AMF cultivation under controlled conditions. This progress will be a prelude to the development of a future ‘ecological engineering of AMF and their associated microorganisms’ and its integration into modern plant breeding while taking care of the ecosystem services rendered by these valuable fungi.

## Future work
- Tillage may change the AMF community composition by positively selecting more tolerant AMF species and by impacting on the ability of CMNs to transfer defence signals ([^Brito_et+al_2012_a]; Brıgido et al, 2017). Taken together, all of these findings highlight the importance of CMNs and the imperative need for further research on their function and role, in the context of agroecological management.
