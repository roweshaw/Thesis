## Abstract
New Phytologist potential of mating-related processes has been obtained ([^Corradi_2017_a]). They have a rather long history of taxonomic revisions, ==which reflects the general difficulty in resolving the earliest branches in the fungal genealogy==. ==Ribosomal DNA-based phylogenies placed them in the Glomeromycota phylum== which is considered a sister group to Dikarya (Schu€ssler et al., 2001). An extensive phylogenomic study, based on kingdom-wide sampling of fungal species and genome-scale sampling of loci, placed AMF in the subphylum Glomeromycotina with a close relationship with Mortierellomycotina ([^Spatafora_et+al_2016_a]).

## Key points
- Plant roots, under inorganic phosphate (Pi) limiting conditions, release strigolactones (SLs), carotenoid-derived molecules with hormone functions in plants ([^Waters_et+al_2017_a]</a></a>)
- Myc factors LCOs/COs mutants displayed aborted colonization attempts and reduced arbuscules formation, respectively ([^Yoshida_et+al_2012_a]; [^Foo_et+al_2013_a]; [^Gutjahr_et+al_2015_a]</a>), and a rice mutant defective in the karrikin receptor D14-LIKE/KAI2 is characterized by an absence of hyphopodia ([^Gutjahr_et+al_2015_a]</a>)
- The rice d14l/ kai2 mutant lacks the transcriptional response to fungal germinating spore exudates, indicating that the karrikin receptor complex may be involved in perception of the fungus
- Ectopic expression of MYB1 is associated with a decreased root length colonization, stretches of hyphae without arbuscules and a high incidence of degenerated arbuscules ([^Floss_et+al_2017_a]). These results indicate genetic redundancy at the level of MYB1 when Pi is delivered normally
- An Arabidopsis double mutant defective in PHR1 and PHL1, encoding two redundant master transcriptional regulators of Pi starvation responses, showed an upregulation of plant defence genes leading to an atypical composition of a synthetic bacterial community at low as well as high Pi conditions. These results are in line with the observation that Arabidopsis roots induce defence genes when colonized at high Pi conditions by the fungal endophyte C. tofieldiae ([^Hacquard_et+al_2016_a]), which promotes plant growth under low-Pi conditions by translocating Pi to the host ([^Hiruma_et+al_2016_a]), reminiscent of what occurs in AM symbiosis
- The characterization of putative AMF effectors and the identification of factors involved in the perception of plant signals, nutrient uptake, transport and metabolism will be an active field of research and should involve AMF species-comparisons to foster an understanding of AMF functional diversity

## Synopsis

### Plant exudates activate the fungus
AMF and plants rely on reciprocal recognition before physical contact ([^Nadal_2013_a]; [^Bonfante_2015_a]).
SLs are plant-derived, they do not appear to play an important role at the host side because rice mutants defective in the alpha-beta hydrolase SLs receptor D14, are not perturbed in AM colonization ([^Yoshida_et+al_2012_a]; [^Gutjahr_et+al_2015_a]).
The rice d14l/ kai mutant lacks the transcriptional response to fungal germinating spore exudates, indicating that the karrikin receptor complex may be involved in perception of the fungus.
It is not yet clear whether a karrikin-like compound of fungal or plant origin acts as ligand of the D14L receptor in plant–AMF recognition ([^Gutjahr_et+al_2015_a]</a></a>; [^Waters_et+al_2017_a]).
Identification of the NOPE1 substrate will add an exciting new aspect to plant biology in general, as GlcNac-based signalling molecules are currently only known from bacteria and fungi but not – to the knowledge – from plants

### Fungal chitin-based molecules elicit symbiotic plant responses
AMF use GlcNAc-based molecules as pre-contact signals to activate symbiotic responses in the host plant such as calcium spiking, lateral root formation, starch accumulation and gene expression ([^Gutjahr_et+al_2009_a]; [^Mukherjee_2011_a]; [^Czaja_et+al_2012_a]; [^Genre_et+al_2013_a]</a>; [^Camps_et+al_2015_a]; [^Sun_et+al_2015_a]).
These so called ‘Myc Factors’ include lipo-chito-oligosaccharides (MycLCOs, Maillet et al, 2011) and short chitin tetra- and pentamers (Myc-COs; [^Genre_et+al_2013_a]</a>) (Fig. 2).
SLs biosynthesis gene LjCCD7, was upregulated following exposure to these VOCs, suggesting that SLs may act as mediators of such a response ([^Sun_et+al_2015_b])

### An emerging role for fungal effectors in AM symbiosis
In addition to GlcNAc-containing molecules, other AMFproduced factors contribute to interkingdom communication.
Kamel et al (2017) identified a small set of SPs, shared by R. irregularis and G. rosea, with similar expression patterns in the different host plants
These genes, which have been referred to as the AM symbiotic core secretome, encode proteases or protein with unknown function.
RiPEIP1 expression in Oidiodendron maius, an ericoid endomycorrhizal fungus, for which transformation protocols are available, led to enhanced colonization capacity compared to the O. maius WT strain ([^Fiorilli_et+al_2016_a]</a>)
Because it encodes a four-transmembrane domain protein, RiPEIP1 does not fit to the canonical definition of effectors; further studies are needed to define the mechanism of action of RiPEP1 and its specific role in the process of AM colonization.
The interference with RNA metabolism of the host plant can be envisaged for the so-called RALPH (RNase-Like Proteins associated with Haustoria) the secreted avirulence effectors described in the obligate biotroph pathogenic fungus Blumeris graminis ([^Spanu_2017_a])

### Nutritional and regulatory roles for key metabolites in the AM symbiosis
After the AM symbiosis has been established, both symbionts benefit from nutrient supply by the other partner.
Accumulating evidence indicates that the exchanged nutrients function as nourishment, and act as signals that can drastically influence AM development.
AM development is strongly linked to symbiotic function

### AMF receive lipids as well as carbohydrates from the host
Based on stable isotope labelling experiments, it has long been established that AMF receive carbohydrates and glucose from the plant ([^Pfeffer_et+al_1999_a]; Trepanier et al, 2005).
[^Keymer_et+al_2017_a]) measured lipid transfer in nontransgenic plants by isotopolog profiling of 16:0 and 16:1 FAs. Transgenic Medicago roots carrying UcFatB synthesized lauric acid and it was detected in the spores of colonizing R. irregularis ([^Jiang_et+al_2017_a]</a>; [^Luginbuehl_et+al_2017_a]), unequivocally demonstrating that lauric acid containing lipids were transferred from the host to AMF.
STR together with its complex partner STR2 ([^Zhang_et+al_2010_a]) is considered a good candidate transporter for lipid transfer across the PAM ([^Gutjahr_et+al_2012_a]; [^Bravo_et+al_2017_a]</a>; [^Keymer_2018_a]</a>)
Taken together, these recent findings indicate that AMF are entirely dependent on lipid supply by the plant for their growth, development and reproduction.
These findings change the view on the energy balance of the symbiosis, in which the burden of organic carbon compound biosynthesis is more significantly shifted towards the plant than was assumed previously

### Mechanisms of phosphate transfer from AMF to plant hosts
Phosphorus (P) is a major macronutrient limiting for plant growth. It occurs in soils predominantly as dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4À, Pi; [^Nussaume_et+al_2011_a]).
AM-inducible PT genes have been identified in different host plants ([^Rausch_et+al_2001_a]; [^Harrison_et+al_2002_a]; Paszkowski et al, 2002; [^Nagy_et+al_2005_a]; [^Balestrini_et+al_2007_a]; [^Javot_et+al_2007_a]; [^Xu_et+al_2007_a]; [^Loth-Pereda_et+al_2011_a]; [^Hong_et+al_2012_a]</a>; [^Yang_et+al_2012_a]</a></a>; [^Willmann_et+al_2013_a]; [^Xie_et+al_2013_a]; [^Walder_et+al_2015_a]; [^Volpe_et+al_2016_a]</a></a>; [^Sawers_et+al_2017_a])
They are homologues of the yeast PHO84 and belong to the Phosphate transporter 1 (Pht1) class ([^Poirier_2002_a]) of the plant H+/Pi symporters.
This suggests that PT4 is involved in root architecture responses to low Pi, in addition to symbiotic Pi uptake

### Phosphate status influences AM development
When a fungal PT or plant PT genes essential for symbiosis are mutated or silenced arbuscule development is affected ([^Javot_et+al_2007_a]</a>; [^Yang_et+al_2012_a]</a></a>; [^Volpe_et+al_2016_a]</a>; [^Xie_et+al_2016_a]</a>) by accelerated arbuscule turnover ([^Javot_et+al_2007_a]</a>).
An Arabidopsis double mutant defective in PHR1 and PHL1, encoding two redundant master transcriptional regulators of Pi starvation responses, showed an upregulation of plant defence genes leading to an atypical composition of a synthetic bacterial community at low as well as high Pi conditions
These results are in line with the observation that Arabidopsis roots induce defence genes when colonized at high Pi conditions by the fungal endophyte C. tofieldiae ([^Hacquard_et+al_2016_a]), which promotes plant growth under low-Pi conditions by translocating Pi to the host ([^Hiruma_et+al_2016_a]), reminiscent of what occurs in AM symbiosis.
High Pi treatment led to downregulation of 29 putative secreted proteins, including the SLs-induced putative secreted protein (SlS1) ([^Sugimura_2017_a]</a></a>), pointing to an effect of the reduced SLs production of the plant

### Plant growth responses cannot be predicted by AMF phylogeny
Despite a rather modest morphological variation, AMF show a high level of genetic variability.
With the exception of total spore volume, none of the considered fungal traits was positively correlated with plant performance ([^Koch_et+al_2017_a]</a>).
This suggests that molecular features such as the repertoire of fungal signalling molecules, effectors or the abundance and efficiency of nutrient transport proteins may play a more important role for plant performance than AMF growth and morphology.
Plant growth promotion may not be the only trait that should be considered: other benefits such as tolerance to abiotic or biotic stresses could provide a different picture
This knowledge will be fundamental to predict the impact of inoculation with specific AMF on plant performance.
These new findings and expected advances in the understanding of AMF genetics and life cycle may even pave the way to genetic strain improvement for applied purposes

### Plant responsiveness to AMF is subject to genetic diversity
The AMF, and the plant genotype strongly affects the outcome of the symbiosis ([^Smith_et+al_2004_a]; Fig. 5).
The capacity of the maize lines to profit from the symbiosis in terms of shoot dry weight and shoot Pi content correlated with the amount of associated extraradical hyphae ([^Sawers_et+al_2017_a]; Fig. 5)
This suggested an influence of plant genetics on fungal growth performance and, an impact of fungal morphology on plant performance when comparisons are based on only one fungal isolate.
Suppression of root colonization at high Pi was more pronounced in the domesticated plants ([^Martın-Robles_et+al_2018_a]</a>)
Together, this indicates that – at least in the tested species – domestication selected for AM independence at high Pi concentrations, which possibly increased yield in the absence of the fungus-associated carbon drain.
As AMF provide other services to plants such as increased resistance to abiotic stress and certain pathogens, it remains to be investigated whether other stresses would enhance AMresponsiveness of domesticated plants under high Pi fertilization

### Perspectives
It is commonly accepted that soil biodiversity promotes multiple ecosystem functions and that the tailored management of soil communities, including AMF, has the potential to enhance agricultural sustainability ([^Bender_et+al_2016_a]).
The full complement of the microbiota living inside AMF certainly deserves further investigation to define their influence on the metabolism of the fungal host and the potential impact on plant performance.
The characterization of putative AMF effectors and the identification of factors involved in the perception of plant signals, nutrient uptake, transport and metabolism will be an active field of research and should involve AMF species-comparisons to foster an understanding of AMF functional diversity.
It is becoming increasingly clear that despite their large host range, the efficiency of AMF in promoting plant performance differs strongly among fungal species and isolates, and the ability of the plant to respond to the symbiosis depends on the plant genotype.
The identification of the genetic polymorphisms underlying differences in symbiotic performance of plants and AMF will be key to smart breeding for profitable application of the AM symbiosis in sustainable agricultural systems with reduced chemical fertilizer and pesticide input


## Study subjects

### 3 plant species
- Indeed, a comparison of the transcriptomes from R. irregularis and G. rosea, when colonizing three different host plants (the dicotyledon M. truncatula, the monocotyledon Brachypodium distachyon and the liverwort Lunularia cruciata), revealed that the expression of putative SPs can differ depending on the host plant. ==Among 87 SP genes expressed in the intraradical mycelium of R. irregularis only 33 were expressed in all three plant species ([^Kamel_et+al_2017_a]), suggesting that these 33 fulfill core functions, whereas the others may act hostspecifically (Fig. 3)==. Remarkably, a larger proportion (74%) of host-specific SPs was found in G. rosea with respect to R. irregularis (44%) and this may reflect differences in the their host range

### 6 isolates of Magnaporthe species
- In plant–pathogen interactions effectors can play a significant role in host specificity ([^Hung_et+al_2014_a]). ==Regarding SPs, a recent study compared the complete genome sequence of six isolates of Magnaporthe species obtained from three different host plants==. An inventory of SPs showed that many new SPs have evolved in different isolates and, interestingly, some of these SPs are only present in groups of isolates from the same host plant suggesting that the evolution of SPs is under host-directed selection ([^Zhong_et+al_2016_a])

### 3 AM-induced lipid biosynthesis genes
- Surprisingly, it was found that genes encoding the cytosolic fatty acids (FA) synthase subunits, which are responsible for the bulk FA production in fungi, are absent from AMF genomes ([^Wewer_et+al_2014_a]; [^Tang_et+al_2016_a]). ==At approximately the same time it was discovered that legume mutants with stunted arbuscules and with reduced colonization were defective in three AM-induced lipid biosynthesis genes: DISORGANIZED ARBUSCULES (DIS), FatM and REDUCED ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA 2 ([^Wang_et+al_2012_a]; [^Bravo_et+al_2016_a], [^Bravo_et+al_2017_a]; [^Jiang_et+al_2017_a]; [^Keymer_et+al_2017_a]</a>; [^Luginbuehl_et+al_2017_a])==. DIS encodes a b-keto-acyl-ACP synthase I (KASI), which is specific to genomes of AM-competent gymnosperms and dicots and catalyses FA chain elongation from C4 to C16 ([^Keymer_et+al_2017_a]</a>)

## Findings
- A large majority (95%) of R. irregularis secreted proteins (SPs) is conserved in the related species R. clarus, whereas only 194 of 872 (22%) of R. irregularis SPs show similarity with those from Gigaspora rosea, a distantly related AMF (Sezdzielewska Toro & Brachmann, 2016; [^Kamel_et+al_2017_a])
- A larger proportion (74%) of host-specific SPs was found in G. rosea with respect to R. irregularis (44%) and this may reflect differences in the their host range

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- An Arabidopsis double mutant defective in PHR1 and PHL1, encoding two redundant master transcriptional regulators of Pi starvation responses, showed an upregulation of plant defence genes leading to an atypical composition of a synthetic bacterial community at low as well as high Pi conditions. ==These results are in line with the observation that Arabidopsis roots induce defence genes when colonized at high Pi conditions by the fungal endophyte C==. tofieldiae ([^Hacquard_et+al_2016_a]), which promotes plant growth under low-Pi conditions by translocating Pi to the host ([^Hiruma_et+al_2016_a]), reminiscent of what occurs in AM symbiosis

## Future work
- Because it encodes a four-transmembrane domain protein, RiPEIP1 does not fit to the canonical definition of effectors; further studies are needed to define the mechanism of action of RiPEP1 and its specific role in the process of AM colonization.
