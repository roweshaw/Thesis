## Abstract
of fungal carbon nourishment during AM symbiosis. AM fungal colonization results in increased expression of source-to-sink metabolizing genes Sucrose Transporters (SUTs) and Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporters (SWEETs) as well as genes encoding sucrose metabolizing enzymes Sucrose Synthase and Invertases. ====Fungal uptake of apoplastic hexoses are likely mediated by Monosaccharide Transporter==2== (MST2) ==that is induced around intra-radical== hyphae (IH) and arbuscules. Upregulation of MST5/6 in spores and extra-radical mycelia (ERM) suggest that AM fungi may also be able to take up glucose (Glc) from their surrounding. AM-conserved genes, RAM2 and ==FatM are induced in arbuscule-containing cells== and are required for synthesis of the C16:0 fatty acid, b-monoacylglycerol (b-MAG). ABC transporters STR1/STR2 that localize to the peri-arbuscular membrane (PAM) might play a role in the transport of b-MAG into the symbiotic interface from where it is taken up by the fungus and utilized for arbuscule formation.

## Synopsis

### Introduction
The symbiotic success in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses for over 400 million years has involved host– fungal transactions, underpinned by a tightly regulated reciprocal nutrient exchange based on mutual rewards.
For AM fungi, forming a successful symbiosis with plants is an obligate requirement to complete their life-cycle, manifested by the production of daughter spores [^1].
A role for carbohydrates in sustaining fungal growth during AM symbiosis AM fungi acquire sugar in the form of hexoses, predominantly glucose [^6],[^9],[^10].
RiMST2 has promiscuous substrate specificity for hexoses with preference for xylose and is present in extraradical mycelium (ERM), around IH and arbuscules during the interaction with potato and M. truncatula [^12], indicating that sugar uptake in AM fungi might involve IH in addition to arbuscules, which is supported by earlier radiotracer-based observations (Figure 1, [^6]).

### Current Opinion in Plant Biology
AM fungal colonization results in increased expression of source-to-sink metabolizing genes Sucrose Transporters (SUTs) and Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporters (SWEETs) as well as genes encoding sucrose metabolizing enzymes Sucrose Synthase and Invertases.
Fungal uptake of apoplastic hexoses are likely mediated by Monosaccharide Transporter (MST2) that is induced around intra-radical hyphae (IH) and arbuscules.
Functional analysis of RiMST2 by knocking down RiMST2 using hostinduced gene silencing (HIGS) led to severely compromised fungal colonisation and abnormal arbuscule morphology [^12].
This confirmed the importance of plant carbohydrates for the maintenance of IH and arbuscule growth and suggested cell wall monosaccharides as a source of organic C for AM fungi.

### Gene expression
Promoters of genes encoding distinct members of potato SWEETs were recently shown to be active within and next to arbuscule-hosting cells (Figure 1, Table 1B, [^20]).
SWEET activity may lead to the release of sugars into the interface between the plant and the fungal membrane and thereby fine-tune sugar fluxes and availability in colonized and adjacent non-colonized cortex cells.
Knockdown of the tomato sucrose transporter SUT2, but not SUT1 or SUT4, led to increased mycorrhizal colonization and abolished the positive growth response to AMS in tomato, intuitively pointing towards a fungal advantage in the competition for carbohydrates in the absence of functional SUT2 (Figure 1, Table 1B, [^22]).

### Increased colonization compared to WT
FatM function appeared to be the result of timing and heightened expression culminating in the increased release of C16:0 free fatty acids from plastids during AM symbiosis (Figure 1, [^38])
This points to a fungal requirement of FatM for arbuscule development or for supplying lipids building the PAM [^37].
It is noteworthy that the different mutant phenotypes share the commonality that the fungus is able to continue intraradical spreading despite a lack of vesicle and spore production
These observations support a hypothesis whereby carbohydrate uptake promote intraradical fungal proliferation, for completion of the fungal life cycle alternative C sources such as FAs are required that are essential for arbuscule development.
Uncovering their function and regulation during AM symbiosis will unleash new insights into organic C nurture of AM fungi and into ancient host-fungal transactions that drive AM symbiosis

##  Builds on previous research
- This points to a fungal requirement of FatM for arbuscule development or for supplying lipids building the PAM [^37]. In addition to FatM, the ==earlier reported Reduced Arbuscular Mycorrhization 2== (RAM2) also belongs to the phylogenetically conserved AM-specific genes [^37]
