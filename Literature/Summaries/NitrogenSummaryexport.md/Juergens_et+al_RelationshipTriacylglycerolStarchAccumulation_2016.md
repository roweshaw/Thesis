## Abstract
Because of the potential importance of algae for green biotechnology, ==considerable effort has been invested in understanding their responses to nitrogen deprivation==. The most ==frequently invoked reasons proposed for the accumulation of high cellular levels== of triacylglycerol (TAG) and starch are variants of what may be termed the “overflow hypothesis.” According to this, growth inhibition results in the rate of photosynthetic energy and/or carbon input exceeding cellular needs; ==the excess input is directed into the accumulation of TAG== and/or starch to prevent damage. ==This study was aimed at providing a quantitative dataset and analysis of the main energy and carbon flows== before and during nitrogen deprivation in a model system to assess alternative explanations. Cellular growth, biomass, starch, and lipid levels as ==well as several measures of photosynthetic function were recorded for cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultured under== nine different autotrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic conditions during nutrient-replete growth and for the first 4 d of nitrogen deprivation. The results of a 13C labeling time course indicated that in mixotrophic culture, ==starch is predominantly made from CO2== and ==fatty acid synthesis is largely supplied by exogenous acetate==, with considerable turnover of membrane lipids, so that total lipid ==rather than TAG is the appropriate measure of product accumulation==. Heterotrophic cultures accumulated TAG and starch during N deprivation, showing that these are not dependent on photosynthesis. ==We conclude that the overflow hypothesis is insufficient== and suggest that storage may be a more universally important reason for carbon compound accumulation during nutrient deprivation.

## Key points
- Because of the potential importance of algae for green biotechnology, considerable effort has been invested in understanding their responses to nitrogen deprivation
- Based on these findings and a reinterpretation of the literature, we suggest that starch and oil synthesis are better explained as means for the storage of biosynthetic precursors and/or chemical energy for survival of nutrient deprivation and to aid in recovery
- The first observation of microalgal TAG accumulation under nitrogen deprivation was made over a century ago ([^Beijerinck_1904_a]), and the potential to utilize this phenomenon for biofuels has been recognized for over 70 years (Harder and von Witsch, 1942a, 1942b)
- The overflow hypothesis (OH) explains the synthesis of TAG and/ or starch by algae during nutrient deprivation as a response to excess photosynthetic energy and/or carbon assimilation
- The results of this study allow a thorough assessment to be made of the OH in its straightforward form for the first time by making a series of inferences from it about the relationships between photosynthetic cultures in C for N-replete cells, 0 to 24 h of N deprivation, and 24 to 96 h of deprivation
- The preponderance of fatty acid molecules in all pools were either unlabeled or highly labeled, and since the total fatty acid content of the cultures approximately doubled during the 40-h labeling period, we infer that 75% or more of the carbon used to synthesize fatty acids during N deprivation is derived from acetate taken up during deprivation
- We conclude either that starch accumulation during nitrogen deprivation is primarily driven by factors unrelated to photosynthetic overflow or that there is a separate additional explanation for its accumulation under heterotrophic conditions

## Synopsis

### Introduction
Because of the potential importance of algae for green biotechnology, considerable effort has been invested in understanding their responses to nitrogen deprivation.
Roessler (1990) appears to have been the first to postulate that algae accumulate TAG as a sink for excess photosynthetic energy and reductant to prevent photochemical damage
In this explanation, photosynthetic carbon and energy assimilation that can no longer be directed to growth when population increase is inhibited by nutrient deficiency or other stresses results in overflow products, TAG (Du and Benning, 2016).
The idea of photosynthetic overflow as the driver of oil accumulation has become a widely accepted explanation ([^Hu_et+al_2008_a]</a>; [^Li_et+al_2012_a]</a>; [^Solovchenko_2012_a]; Li et al, 2013; [^Klok_et+al_2014_a]</a>; Du and Benning, 2016)
This overflow hypothesis (OH) strongly influences research efforts and the interpretation of results in biological and engineering studies of microalgal metabolism and TAG accumulation and has important implications for the ecophysiology of photosynthetic microbes.
While frequently invoked in interpreting the results of nutrient deprivation studies, the OH has not been systematically assessed

### Objectives
This study was aimed at providing a quantitative dataset and analysis of the main energy and carbon flows before and during nitrogen deprivation in a model system to assess alternative explanations.
This study was aimed at providing a quantitative description of metabolic and photosynthetic functional rates across a full range of autotrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic conditions before and during nutrient deprivation

### Methods
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain cc400 cw-15 ++mt was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Research Center and grown at 23°C in 200 mL liquid TAP media ([^Gorman_1965_a]) and Sueoka HS media ([^Sueoka_1960_a]) in 1-liter flasks shaken at 125 rpm under continuous illumination at 160, 40, 15, 5, and 0 mmol photons m22 s21 and ambient CO2 concentrations.
The acetate concentration in TAP media is 17.5 mM and the nitrogen from NH4Cl is 9.5 mM in HS compared to 7.0 mM in TAP.
Growth rate and photosynthetic fluorescence parameters during nitrogen deprivation were compared for cells in TAP media without acetate (TP) and cells in HS media
These were not significantly different, showing that the presence of acetate is the predominant cause of differences between cells cultured in HS and TAP media

### Results
To characterize the effect of light and trophic conditions on Chlamydomonas growth rates, cells were grown in defined media either with acetate as a fixed carbon source (Tris acetate phosphate [TAP] media) or without acetate at light levels of 0, 5, 15, 40, and 160 mmol photons m22 s21.
This range of light intensity spans heterotrophic growth in the dark in TAP media, light-limited autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions, and saturating light levels.
Increasing illumination from 40 to 160 mmol photons m22 s21 did not increase growth rate, suggesting that these cells are carbon limited ([^Spalding_1989_a]; [^Goldman_et+al_1974_a]).
This suggestion was supported by the observation that specific growth rates increased approximately 2-fold for autotrophically grown cells at 160 mmol photons m22 s21 when humidified ambient air was circulated through the culture flasks to increase CO2 availability

### Conclusion
The first observation of microalgal TAG accumulation under nitrogen deprivation was made over a century ago ([^Beijerinck_1904_a]), and the potential to utilize this phenomenon for biofuels has been recognized for over 70 years (Harder and von Witsch, 1942a, 1942b).
The OH, at least 25 years old (Roessler, 1990), currently holds sway over much of the interpretation of algal TAG accumulation data.
The OH explains the synthesis of TAG and/ or starch by algae during nutrient deprivation as a response to excess photosynthetic energy and/or carbon assimilation.
The authors conclude either that starch accumulation during nitrogen deprivation is primarily driven by factors unrelated to photosynthetic overflow or that there is a separate additional explanation for its accumulation under heterotrophic conditions.
Heterotrophic cells from taxa as diverse as fungi bacteria and mammals have been shown to accumulate TAG under nutrient deprivation ([^Alvarez_2002_a]; [^Frenk_et+al_1958_a]; Packter and Olukoshi, 1995; Morin et al, 2011; Murphy, 2001)


## Study subjects

### 3 data
- Empty diamonds, cells cultured at 160 mmol photons m22 s21 (mE); empty squares, 40 mE; empty triangles, 15 mE; filled diamonds, 5 mE; filled squares, 0 mE. ==Error bars indicate 6SD (n = 3)==. are similar to those used in many prior studies and showed the highest sustained starch and lipid accumulation rates

### 2 data
- Filled squares represent unlabeled molecules (M+0); filled diamonds, M+1 (one 13C atom); empty triangles, M+2; empty circles, the sum of M+3 through M+16 (fully labeled). ==Error bars indicate range (n = 2)==. deprivation is the dominant source of carbon for net starch synthesis during N deprivation under mixotrophic conditions

### 3 data
- Illustration of the major carbon and energy inputs and outputs of Chlamydomonas cells. CO2 provides C input, light provides energy input, and acetate provides both. Incoming energy can be dissipated as heat, consumed for maintenance, or used in cell growth or biosynthesis of storage compounds (starch and oil). Incoming carbon is used in growth, stored in starch or oil, or respired as CO2. The taps indicate sites of regulation by the cell for which the literature provides support. ==Growth rates during exponential growth in nitrogen-replete media with acetate (TAP media; squares) and or without (HS media; circles) under continuous illumination at light levels from 0 to 160 mmol photons m22 s21. Rates are presented as millions of new cells produced per milliliter of culture per hour by a culture at a density of 106 per mL. These represent the specific, or relative growth rates (RGR), which are the rate constants for exponential growth according to the formula n = No.emt, where n is the number of cells per mL at time T, No is the initial cell density, and m is the relative growth rate. RGR is inversely related to doubling time: RGR = Ln (2)/tdoubling. Error bars indicate 6SD (n = 3 biological replicates)==. Cellular biomass and percentage of carbon and nitrogen for N-replete and N-deprived cultures. Biomass is given as AFDW per million cells (A and B), %C (C and D), and %N (E and F) and is reported for cultures grown in TAP (A, C, and E) and HS (B, D, and F) media and deprived of N at time 0. Empty diamonds, cells cultured at 160 photons m22 s21 (mE); empty squares, 40 mE; empty triangles, 15 mE; filled diamonds, 5 mE; filled squares, 0 mE. Error bars indicate 6SD (n = 3)

## Findings
- Cellular biomass in N replete cells is very similar across light levels, with mixotrophic and heterotrophic cultures (TAP medium) having approximately 25% more AFDW than autotrophic cultures
- After 40 h of N deprivation in the presence of 13C-acetate, the proportion of starch-derived ions detected that were labeled with 13C was found to be low, with over 65% of the ions containing no 13C label (Fig. 5A) and over 80% of the total carbon being 12C
- The preponderance of fatty acid molecules in all pools were either unlabeled or highly labeled, and since the total fatty acid content of the cultures approximately doubled during the 40-h labeling period, we infer that 75% or more of the carbon used to synthesize fatty acids during N deprivation is derived from acetate taken up during deprivation
- Since the cellular levels of membrane lipids fall by more than 50% during this time ([^Juergens_et+al_2015_a]), it is clear that substantial rates of simultaneous synthesis and breakdown of membrane lipids are occurring
- The proportion of energy taken in by cells that is stored in biomass is shown in Figure 10, E and F. This varies from ;2% for cells at higher light levels, up to 75% for heterotrophic cells after 48 h of nitrogen deprivation
- Fluorescence yields from saturating pulses were measured under actinic light and averaged over six measurements, separated by 120-s intervals. Both absorption and fluorescence measuring pulses were 20 to 35 ms in duration and attenuated to produce less than 0.1% increase in chlorophyll fluorescence yield in dark-adapted samples

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- start than increases in TAG. This is ==consistent with previous reports that membrane lipid levels fall during N deprivation and that some fatty acids used in TAG synthesis come from membrane lipids== ([^Yoon_et+al_2012_a]; Moellering and Benning, 2011; [^Juergens_et+al_2015_a])

## Contributions
- We conclude either that starch accumulation during nitrogen deprivation is primarily driven by factors unrelated to photosynthetic overflow or that there is a separate additional explanation for its accumulation under heterotrophic conditions. TAG accumulation in the dark was also significant, although net fatty acid accumulation was modest compared to cultures in the light. Indeed, heterotrophic cells from taxa as diverse as fungi bacteria and mammals have been shown to accumulate TAG under nutrient deprivation ([^Alvarez_2002_a]; [^Frenk_et+al_1958_a]; Packter and Olukoshi, 1995; Morin et al, 2011; Murphy, 2001).

## Future work
- Further experiments are underway to assess these alternative explanations.
