## Abstract
Background: Local adaptation, the differential success of genotypes in their native versus foreign environment, arises from various evolutionary processes, but the importance of concurrent abiotic and biotic factors as drivers of local adaptation has only recently been investigated. Local adaptation to biotic interactions may be particularly important for plants, as they associate with microbial symbionts that can significantly affect their fitness and may enable rapid evolution. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is ideal for investigations of local adaptation because it is globally widespread among most plant taxa and can significantly affect plant growth and fitness. ==Using meta-analysis on 1170 studies (from 139 papers), we investigated the potential for local adaptation to shape plant growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation==.
Results: The magnitude and direction for mean effect size of mycorrhizal inoculation on host biomass depended on the geographic origin of the soil and symbiotic partners. Sympatric combinations of plants, AM fungi, and soil yielded large increases in host biomass compared to when all three components were allopatric. The origin of either the fungi or the plant relative to the soil was important for explaining the effect of AM inoculation on plant biomass. If plant and soil were sympatric but allopatric to the fungus, the positive effect of AM inoculation was much greater than when all three components were allopatric, suggesting potential local adaptation of the plant to the soil; however, if fungus and soil were sympatric (but allopatric to the plant) the effect of AM inoculation was indistinct from that of any allopatric combinations, indicating maladaptation of the fungus to the soil.
Conclusions: This study underscores the potential to detect local adaptation for mycorrhizal relationships across a broad swath of the literature. Geographic origin of plants relative to the origin of AM fungal communities and soil is important for describing the effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on plant biomass, suggesting that local adaptation represents a powerful factor for the establishment of novel combinations of fungi, plants, and soils. These results highlight the need for subsequent investigations of local adaptation in the mycorrhizal symbiosis and emphasize the importance of routinely considering the origin of plant, soil, and fungal components.

## Key points
- Local adaptation, the differential success of genotypes in their native versus foreign environment, arises from various evolutionary processes, but the importance of concurrent abiotic and biotic factors as drivers of local adaptation has only recently been investigated
- Our objective was to explore the potential role of local adaptation in shaping arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal relationships with their plant hosts (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S2)
- We report results for both between-study analyses of studies in which the plant, fungal partner, and soil origin were all known (Analysis Group 1: Between-study Analyses; Fig. 1), and results from analyses of a smaller subset of the studies that varied the geographic origin of the plant, AM fungal inoculum, and/or soil within the same published papers (Analysis Group 2: Withinpaper Analyses; Fig. 1)
- For Analysis Group 1, analyses were conducted for all available studies (‘Full Dataset’) and for two subsets, one in which only a single fungal species was used as inoculum (‘Single Species’) and one in which studies were only conducted in the laboratory (‘Lab Studies’: greenhouses, growth chambers, lathe houses, or shade houses)
- Our results suggest that when the origin of the plant, AM fungi, and soil is known, local adaptation may be important for describing the effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on host biomass
- To accurately evaluate the full extent to which local adaptation among plants, fungi, and soils plays in altering plant response to mycorrhizal inoculation, our analysis focused on those studies in which information about the plant, fungus, and soil origin was known (‘PlantFungal-Soil’)

## Synopsis

### Introduction
The differential success of genotypes in their native versus foreign environment, arises from various evolutionary processes, but the importance of concurrent abiotic and biotic factors as drivers of local adaptation has only recently been investigated.
The mechanisms that promote or suppress local adaptation may vary spatially and temporally [^2], detecting patterns of local adaptation can provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of species and their interactions
Such processes may be important for plants, which commonly associate with a wide variety of microbial symbionts that can have profound effects on plant fitness and their evolution [^6].
Given that the fitness of host and symbionts can be independent, there is potential for local symbionts to enhance or decrease plant local adaptation
To tease apart these dynamics, investigations regarding local adaptation and mycorrhizal interactions generally utilize experimental designs with reciprocal crosses in which the fitness of the host and/or the symbiont’s genotypes is compared between sympatric and allopatric combinations.
The authors examine whether the geographic origin of the plant host, their AM fungal partner (s), and soil alters plant biomass response to AM inoculation

### Objectives
The authors' objective was to explore the potential role of local adaptation in shaping AM fungal relationships with their plant hosts (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S2)

### Methods
Literature search The authors' analyses utilize MycoDB, a database of 4010 studies from 445 papers in which plants were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth was measured [^57].
To facilitate the exploration of local adaptation using this database, all studies were screened to identify whether the source location was given for at least two of the three components of interest: fungal inoculum, host plant, and soil.
This screen yielded a total of 1170 individual studies from 139 published papers.
Fitness proxies are associated with survival, fecundity, or mating success
In plants, such proxies may include seed production, survival, or more commonly, plant size [^62].
While plants can benefit from mycorrhizal inoculation without increasing in biomass [^63], [^64], these studies are relatively rare and not sufficient in number for meta-analysis

### Results
The magnitude and direction for mean effect size of mycorrhizal inoculation on host biomass depended on the geographic origin of the soil and symbiotic partners.
AM fungi, and soil yielded large increases in host biomass compared to when all three components were allopatric.
For Analysis Group 1, the effect size compared plant growth with versus without mycorrhizal inoculation
Local adaptation in this set of analyses was assessed by comparing this effect size metric among studies differing in whether plants, fungi, and/or soils were sympatric or allopatric in origin.
For Analysis Group 2, the effect size compared plant response to mycorrhizal inoculation in sympatric versus allopatric pairings, and was a direct assessment of local adaptation or maladaptation.

### Discussion
Previous research has emphasized the role of abiotic factors in driving local adaptation of organisms to their local environment, but biotic factors may greatly alter an organism’s fitness in their local environment [^2],[^3],[^4],[^5].
In a symbiotic interaction, in the case of an obligate symbiosis, understanding coadaptation between symbionts and between them and the local environments is essential for local adaptation.
Limited by the amount of available data, the results represent an important first step in addressing local adaptation of a symbiosis.
The authors' results highlight the complexity of the patterns and processes behind local adaptation of plants to mycorrhizal fungi, suggesting that studying plant responses to AM inoculation without considering the geographic origin of the symbionts, plant and soil is neglecting key elements of the interaction.

### Conclusion
This study underscores the potential to detect local adaptation for mycorrhizal relationships across a broad swath of the literature.
Geographic origin of plants relative to the origin of AM fungal communities and soil is important for describing the effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on plant biomass, suggesting that local adaptation represents a powerful factor for the establishment of novel combinations of fungi, plants, and soils.
Of the sympatric relationships, when plant and fungi were sympatric, there is a less positive response by the host plant, suggesting that fungi adapt to the soil environment in such a way as to be less mutualistic to novel host plants
These results have wide ranging implications for future ecological, evolutionary, and applied studies, and suggest that local adaptation of the plant and the fungi to one another and to their soil environment should be considered when designing experiments, preparing restoration campaigns or selecting specific mycorrhizal assemblages for use as inoculants


## Study subjects

### 1170 studies
- The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is ideal for investigations of local adaptation because it is globally widespread among most plant taxa and can significantly affect plant growth and fitness. ==Using meta-analysis on 1170 studies (from 139 papers), we investigated the potential for local adaptation to shape plant growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation==. Results: The magnitude and direction for mean effect size of mycorrhizal inoculation on host biomass depended on the geographic origin of the soil and symbiotic partners

### 4010 studies
- These results highlight the need for subsequent investigations of local adaptation in the mycorrhizal symbiosis and emphasize the importance of routinely considering the origin of plant, soil, and fungal components. ==Literature search Our analyses utilize MycoDB, a database of 4010 studies from 445 papers in which plants were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth was measured [^57]==. Our study focused on only AM fungi (2984 studies from 359 papers), and included any study that added inoculum, regardless of whether it was pure culture inoculum or not

### 2984 studies
- Literature search Our analyses utilize MycoDB, a database of 4010 studies from 445 papers in which plants were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth was measured [^57]. ==Our study focused on only AM fungi (2984 studies from 359 papers), and included any study that added inoculum, regardless of whether it was pure culture inoculum or not==. To facilitate our exploration of local adaptation using this database, all studies were screened to identify whether the source location was given for at least two of the three components of interest: fungal inoculum, host plant, and soil

## Data analysis

- #method/random_effect

## Findings
- AM fungi potentially act as an important selective force for plants because they occur over broad geographic scales and across diverse biotic and abiotic gradients. These well studied fungi are obligate biotrophs and associate with over 80 % of terrestrial plants [^24]
- ORIGIN was significant for explaining plant biomass response to AM inoculation for all three datasets: the Full Dataset (QM (df4) = 11.6, p = 0.021), Single Species (QM (df4) = 10.1, p = 0.039), and Lab Studies (QM (df4) = 9.38, p = 0.052, Table 2)
- For analyses when multiple species of fungi were used as inocula, INOCULUM COMPLEXITY (single species, multiple species, or whole soil inoculum) was significant for explaining plant biomass response to AM inoculation for the Full Dataset (QM (df2) = 7.11, p = 0.027) and tended to be important for Lab Studies (QM (df2) = 5.35, p = 0.069, Table 2)
- Similar to plant-fungal adaptation, INOCULUM COMPLEXITY was the only significant predictor of local adaptation (QM(df1) = 3.89, p = 0.049, Table 3, Fig. 3), with allopatric combinations of the fungus and soil outperforming sympatric combinations for multiple species inocula and no difference between sympatric and allopatric combinations for single species inocula (Fig. 3b)

##  Builds on previous research
- Consequently, understanding patterns of local adaptation can provide practical information for aiding species and habitat management decisions, such as whether inoculation of plants with local genotypes of mutualistic symbionts like mycorrhizal fungi is beneficial to enhance ecosystem services (e.g., food production, restoration of compromised ecosystems, bioremediation, carbon sequestration) [^13], [^44]. To test the degree to which plants benefit from local adaptation of fungi to soils, ==we compared plant mycorrhizal response when fungi and soils were of the same geographic origin (sympatric) compared to when they were of different origins== (allopatric)
- In those analyses, when a single fungal species was used as inoculum, the effect of sympatry was greater than allopatry, suggesting local adaptation, while the reverse was true when fungal inocula contained multiple species (Fig. 3). ==These resu==lts may stem from complementarity among mycorrhizal fungal species, which can provide a greater benefit for the host [^58], [^59]

## Differs from previous work
- Plant and fungal adaptation to each other, plant adaptation to soil, and fungal adaptation to soil can all influence plant response to AM fungi; therefore, in order to fully understand patterns of adaptation within mycorrhizal relationships, it is important to understand such interactions individually. ==Mediation by soil of plant adaptation to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Previous research emphasizes the direct effect that soil properties can have as selective agents on plant populations, whereby the fitness of individuals within populations increases when they can better tolerate specific soil conditions [^35],[^36],[^37]; however==, soil properties may also indirectly influence plant fitness through its effects on mycorrhizal interactions
- Negative feedbacks between AM fungi and their host have been demonstrated experimentally when plant hosts have responded more positively to AM fungal communities collected from non-related host plants than to their own AM fungal communities, largely as a result of asymmetries in the benefits exchanged [^26], [^53]. ==Thus we hypothesize that variation in the geographic origin of soils==, mycorrhizal fungi, and host plants will result in plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation that vary along a continuum from mutualistic to parasitic [^20], [^21], as a result of local adaptation or maladaptation of mycorrhizal fungi and host plants to each other and their soils
- Experimental set-up: Laboratory (greenhouse, growth chamber, lathe house or shade house), field. ==Seven variables were used previously in Hoeksema et al [^23] and one variable was unique to our analyses== (as indicated by asterisk) rather, effect sizes greater than all allopatric combinations indicate some degree of local adaptation while effect sizes smaller than allopatric combinations indicate some degree of maladaptation
- While plants can benefit from mycorrhizal inoculation without increasing in biomass [^63], [^64], these studies are relatively rare and not sufficient in number for meta-analysis. ==Our analysis consisted of studies that fit into two groups==

## Contributions
- This study underscores the potential to detect local adaptation for mycorrhizal relationships across a broad swath of the literature. Geographic origin of plants relative to the origin of AM fungal communities and soil is important for describing the effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on plant biomass, suggesting that local adaptation represents a powerful factor for the establishment of novel combinations of fungi, plants, and soils. These results highlight the need for subsequent investigations of local adaptation in the mycorrhizal symbiosis and emphasize the importance of routinely considering the origin of plant, soil, and fungal components.<br/><br/>Keywords: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Community ecology, Evolution, Geographic origin, Soil micro-organisms, Local adaptation, Symbiosis<br/><br/>Rúa et al BMC Evolutionary Biology (2016) 16:122

## Limitations
- Model was severely limited by the available data. Consequently, the data available for this analysis were relatively homogenous and the variability in the model was larger than expected based on sampling variability alone (QE(df26) = 27.6, p = 0.379, Table 3). While the overall estimated effect size for this model was positive, it did not significantly differ from zero (mean estimate ± standard error: 0.1189 ± 0.327, k = 28), indicating no overall local adaptation or maladaptation.
- Small number of studies available for those analyses, as average effect sizes in those analyses were in the direction of local adaptation. While the importance of matching fungal, soil, and plant origin for increasing plant response to AM fungi has been demonstrated in a select number of grassland species [^13], [^34], [^42], the results presented here represent a more extensive exploration of this phenomenon and thus have important implications for both the ecology and conservation biology of mycorrhizas.
- Study is limited in exploring the effects of other soil organisms for altering such relationships. Our analysis includes any study that added inoculum, regardless of whether it was pure culture inoculum or not, indicating that other components in the inoculum such as nonAM fungal microorganisms could be contributing to plant responses to inoculation; however, it is likely that the presence of other AM species (single species vs. multiple species) is having a larger impact in altering plant response to mycorrhizal inoculation and mediating the role of local adaptation in altering this relationship. This conclusion is supported by our results which indicate that neither the addition of supplementary microbes (MICROBE CONTROL), sterilization of the background soil (STERILITY), nor EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP (laboratory vs. field study) significantly altered plant response to mycorrhizal inoculation for any of the analyses. If non-AM fungal microorganisms in the inocula were important drivers in altering plant response to mycorrhizal inoculation, we would expect that at least one of these variables would be significant. Consequently, it is more likely that the presence of other mycorrhizal species and not of other soil micoorganisms is the important driver for the patterns we found here.

## Future work
- In our study, when the plant and soil were from the same origin (but allopatric to the fungus) the effect of AM inoculation was much greater than when all three components were allopatric (but not different from. These results suggest that further work investigating ecological interactions of AM fungi and their plant hosts should strive to control for variation in fungal, soil, and plant origin as well as inform species and habitat management decisions in order to maximize mycorrhizal applications [^13], [^44]. It is the policy of many habitat managers to restore land using local seed stock (because of the presumed importance of local adaptation) but mycorrhizal inoculum associated with these restoration efforts often comes from inoculum producers, creating a mismatch in the relationship between geographic origin of the plant and soil with the fungal inoculum. Our results suggest that this policy may be just as effective as using locally sourced inoculum but more constrained manipulations are needed.
