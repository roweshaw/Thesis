## Abstract
As an essential plant macronutrient, the low availability of phosphorus (P) in most soils imposes serious limitation on crop production. Plants have evolved complex responsive and adaptive mechanisms for acquisition, remobilization and recycling of phosphate (Pi) to maintain P homeostasis. Spatio‐temporal molecular, physiological, and ==biochemical Pi deficiency responses developed by plants are the consequence of local== and systemic sensing and signaling pathways. Pi deficiency is sensed locally by the root system where hormones serve as important signaling components in terms of developmental reprogramming, leading to changes in root system architecture. Root‐to‐shoot and shoot‐to‐root signals, delivered through the xylem and phloem, respectively, involving Pi itself, hormones, miRNAs, mRNAs, and sucrose, serve to coordinate Pi deficiency responses at the whole‐plant level. A combination of chromatin remodeling, transcriptional and ==posttranslational events contribute to globally regulating a wide range of Pi deficiency responses==. In this review, ==recent advances are evaluated in terms of progress== toward developing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular events underlying control over P homeostasis. Application of this knowledge, in terms of developing crop plants having enhanced attributes for P use efficiency, is discussed from the perspective of agricultural sustainability in the face of diminishing global P supplies.

## Key points
- A wide range of mineral nutrients is required by plants in order to carry out the complex processes involved in the biochemical, cellular, physiological, and developmental processes underlying growth, the ultimate goal of which is the production of viable seeds
- Growth of this mutant in medium containing 1 mmol/L Pi gives rise to axially curled, smaller and necrotic leaves and this phenotype was correlated with much higher intracellular Pi concentrations ([^Stevenson‐Paulik_et+al_2005_a]). This atipk1 mutant is greatly impaired in its ability to sense a change www.jipb.net in Pi concentration that, in wild‐type plants, would elicit an increase in root hair development. These findings indicate that AtIPK1 and its products, IP5 and IP6, are required for Pi sensing and P homeostasis in plants
- The findings offer support for a mechanism in which auxin transport, per se, is altered in roots exposed to Pi‐ deficient conditions, a result that could explain the observed change in root system architecture (RSA) ([^Neumann_et+al_2000_a]; Al‐Ghazi et al 2003; [^Nacry_et+al_2005_a])
- Under Pi deficiency conditions, elevated SL levels are normally accompanied by suppression of bud outgrowth and, shoot branching. As this suppression did not occur in SL‐ deficient or ‐insensitive mutants, these findings provide support for the hypothesis that, in addition to their roles in regulating root architecture, SLs modify shoot growth and structure ([^Czarnecki_et+al_2013_a])
- Analysis of the pho1 mutant, which is defective in loading Pi into the xylem transpiration stream, and, has much lower Pi levels in its shoot ([^Poirier_et+al_1991_a]), does not provide support for this Pi signal hypothesis, given that the phosphate stress responses (PSRs) were suppressed even though the Pi levels were low in the pho1 shoot. These findings suggest that PHO1 may well load other Pi‐stress signals, rather than Pi itself, into the xylem as long‐ distance Pi‐stress signaling agents ([^Rouached_et+al_2011_a])
- SL biosynthesis is greatly upregulated by Pi deficiency in roots, and root‐derived SLs were detected in xylem sap and the level was upregulated by Pi deficiency in Arabidopsis (Kohlen et al 2011)

## Synopsis
A wide range of mineral nutrients is required by plants in order to carry out the complex processes involved in the biochemical, cellular, physiological, and developmental processes underlying growth, the ultimate goal of which is the production of viable seeds.
These findings are consistent with changes in RSA, with inhibition of the primary root and promotion of lateral root growth in Pi deficiency condition, suggestive of a role for ROS in this process.
Role of hormones in local Pi signaling Pi deficiency can change hormone production, sensitivity, and transport ([^Chiou_2011_a]</a>) to regulate expression of PSR genes and RSA.
As this suppression did not occur in SL‐ deficient or ‐insensitive mutants, these findings provide support for the hypothesis that, in addition to their roles in regulating root architecture, SLs modify shoot growth and structure ([^Czarnecki_et+al_2013_a]).
External application of Phi suppresses plant growth through its competitive action of inhibiting Pi uptake; it can repress PSRs, including reducing the change in root‐ shoot‐ratio, root hair development, anthocyanin accumulation, and induction of PSI genes, all of which support the notion that Pi acts as a signal ([^Carswell_et+al_1996_a], [^Carswell_et+al_1997_a]; [^Ticconi_et+al_2001_a]; [^Varadarajan_et+al_2002_a]; [^Hou_et+al_2005_a]; [^Kobayashi_et+al_2006_a]; [^Rouached_et+al_2011_a]).
Adding CK to the medium dramatically reduces Pi‐starvation‐induced anthocyanin accumulation as well as induction of the PSI gene, IPS1 in shoots ([^Franco‐Zorrilla_et+al_2005_a]</a>), suggesting a long‐distance role for CKs in repressing various PSRs. As previously mentioned, SL biosynthesis is greatly upregulated by Pi deficiency in roots, and root‐derived SLs were detected in xylem sap and the level was upregulated by Pi deficiency in Arabidopsis (Kohlen et al 2011).
These findings support the notion that xylem transported SLs are root‐to‐shoot systemic signals to regulate changes in shoot architecture in response to Pi‐limiting conditions being experienced in the root system.
Sucrose has been proposed to be a systemic signal of Pi signaling based on the following observations: (a) shoot‐ derived sucrose translocation in the phloem increases in the early stage of Pi deficiency; (b) Pi deficiency activates sucrose responsive genes; (c) exogenous application of sugars induces many PSR genes and removal of sucrose in the growth medium impaired induction of PSI gene expression; (d) sucrose is required for most, if not all aspects of the Pi‐starvation responses ([^Zakhleniuk_et+al_2001_a]; [^Lloyd_2004_a]; [^Franco‐Zorrilla_et+al_2005_a]</a>; [^Liu_et+al_2005_a]; [^Hermans_et+al_2006_a]; [^Karthikeyan_et+al_2007_a]; [^Hammond_2008_a], [^Hammond_2011_a]; [^Liu_et+al_2009_a], [^Liu_et+al_2010_b]; [^Chiou_2011_a]</a>; [^Lei_et+al_2011_a]; [^Smith_2013_a]).


## Study subjects

### 150 genes
- These studies indicated that many sugar‐responsive genes are regulated by Pi deficiency and Pi deficiency‐responsive genes are also sugar‐inducible. ==Here, some 150 genes were found to be synergistically or antagonistically regulated by sugar and Pi deficiency==. It is noteworthy that the expression of trehalose‐6‐

## Findings
- Plants can remobilize over 50% of P from senescing leaves ([^Aerts_1996_a]); thus, translocation of P from the metabolically inactive older leaves to developing leaves or apical tissues is a quantitatively important source of P for new growth, especially at later growth stages or under P deficiency conditions
- In field‐conducted Pi‐deficient experiments, more than a 20% increase in tiller number, panicle weight, and Pi content was observed in OsPTF1 overexpression lines, compared to wild‐type plants

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- In these experiments, various RNase transcripts were induced, a situation which normally only occurs under Pi deprivation. Certainly ==these findings support the existence of an intracellular Pi sensing mechanism== ([^Koeck_et+al_1998_a])
- In terms of their local effects, numerous studies have ==confirmed that the biosynthesis of SLs is greatly increased in Pi‐ stressed roots of a number of plants, including rice (Umehara et al 2008, 2010), sorghum ([^Yoneyama_et+al_2007_a]), red clover (Yoneyama et al 2007b), tomato (López‐Ráez et al 2008), and fabaceae species ([^Yoneyama_et+al_2008_a]). Consistent with these findings==, rice genes involved in SL biosynthesis (D10, D17, D27) are induced by Pi deficiency, and resupply of Pi then suppresses induction of these genes (Umehara et al 2010)
- These studies indicated that miR399 can act as a phloem‐ mobile shoot‐to‐root signal, a conclusion also ==supported by studies performed on tobacco ([^Lin_et+al_2008_a]). Taken together, these findings offer strong support for a model in Figure 4==
- However, using the split‐ ubiquitin yeast two‐hybrid system, only the interaction between PHO2 and PHT1;4 could be confirmed. ==Consistent with the interaction between PHO2 and PHT1s==, the PHO2‐ mediated ubiquitination of PHT1;1/2/3 was observed in the endomembrane system ([^Huang_et+al_2013_a]</a>)
- In addition, miR827 overexpression down‐regulates NLA expression, whereas in the miR827 mutant background, NLA expression is upregulated, thus confirming that miR827 regulates the action of NLA. ==Consistent with this role==, miR827 overexpression can also cause Pi over‐accumulation ([^Kant_et+al_2011_a])
- Role of mRNAs in shoot‐to‐root Pi‐stress signaling Phloem transcriptomic analyses have revealed that more than 1,000 transcripts with multiple functions are present in phloem sap collected from a number of plant species and, moreover, some 40% of these transcripts appear to be related to stress and defense response signaling ([^Omid_et+al_2007_a]; [^Deeken_et+al_2008_a]; [^Guo_et+al_2013_a]). ==These findings support the notion that the phloem plays a central role as a long==‐distance communication system that integrates abiotic and biotic stress signaling, at the whole‐plant level ([^Lough_2006_a])
- Consistent with their roles in Pi deficiency signaling and changes in RSA, expression of genes for hormone synthesis, signaling, response, and metabolism is changed by long‐term Pi deficiency. ==Here, expression of auxin‐responsive genes, Aux/ IAA family genes, auxin‐responsive transcription factors, polar auxin transport genes, auxin synthesis, and degradation genes was observed to be affected in Pi==‐starved roots, consistent with their roles in primary root inhibition and lateral root enhancement (Uhde‐Stone et al 2003; [^Misson_et+al_2005_a]; O’Rourke et al 2013)

## Future work
- Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which PHF1 acts to control P acquisition through the functioning of Pi transporters.
- Based on these findings, the possibility exists that a member of the PHT1 family of Pi transporters may sense the external Pi status and function as the external Pi sensor (Figure 2). Future studies are required to resolve the question as to whether Pi deficiency is sensed externally, intracellularly or through a combination therein.
- This study reveals yet another example by which PSRs are regulated at the chromatin level. Most certainly, future studies will likely uncover important effects of DNA methylation and histone modification in terms of regulating specific sets of PSR genes.
- Future studies should address the mechanism by which cis‐NATPHO1;2 controls the association of OsPHO1;2 transcripts with polysomes. One possibility is that cis‐NATPHO1;2 can associate with PHO1;2 through its overlapping region and the free 30‐end of cis‐NATPHO1;2 transcript might recruit initiation factors or free ribosomes that could undergo translocation to the 50‐end of the PHO1;2 transcript to begin translation ([^Jabnoune_et+al_2013_a]).
- Future studies on the functions of these Pi‐starvation‐responsive lncRNAs might well elucidate additional novel modes of regulation for processes involved P homeostasis.
