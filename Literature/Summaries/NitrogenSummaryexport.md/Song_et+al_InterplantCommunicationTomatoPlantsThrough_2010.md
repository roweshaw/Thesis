## Abstract
Plants can defend themselves to pathogen and herbivore attack by responding ==to chemical signals that are emitted by attacked plants==. ==It is well established that such signals can be transferred through the air==. In theory, plants can also communicate with each other through underground common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) that interconnect roots of multiple plants. However, ==until now research focused on plant-to-plant carbon nutrient movement== and ==there is no evidence that defense signals can be exchanged through such mycorrhizal hyphal networks==. Here, ==we show that CMNs mediate plantplant communication between healthy plants== and pathogen-infected tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). After establishment of CMNs with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae between tomato plants, inoculation of ‘donor’ ==plants with the pathogen Alternaria solani led to increases in disease resistance and activities== of the putative defensive enzymes, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, chitinase, b-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and lipoxygenase in healthy neighbouring ‘receiver’ plants. The uninfected ‘receiver’ plants also activated six defence-related genes when CMNs connected ‘donor’ plants challenged with A. solani. ==This finding indicates that CMNs may function as a== plant-plant underground communication conduit whereby disease resistance and induced defence signals can be transferred between the healthy and pathogen-infected neighbouring plants, suggesting that plants can ‘eavesdrop’ on defence signals from the pathogen-challenged neighbours through CMNs to activate defences before being attacked themselves.

## Key points
- Plants are challenged by a wide variety of pathogens and pests
- The activity of POD was significantly higher in healthy tomato plants that were connected by the G. mosseae common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) with the pathogen-challenged tomato plants (Fig 1a)
- We demonstrate that CMNs can serve as underground communication conduit transferring defence signals and disease resistance between healthy and pathogen-infected neighbouring plants
- Induced defence in neighbouring plants can be explained by two possible mechanisms: i) aboveground communication can take place by volatiles [^11],[^37],[^38],[^39],[^40] and ii) belowground communication can be mediated by root exudates [^10],[^41]
- We found the highest disease incidence and severity of ‘receiver’ plants in treatment B among the four treatments (Table 1), suggesting that no induced defence occurred when the two plants were not connected with CMNs
- That plants connected with pathogeninfected neighbours by CMNs had less disease damage, higher levels of defence-related enzymatic activities and gene expression than controls without infected neighbours or without CMNs, we suggest that tomato plants can ‘eavesdrop’ on defence signals from the pathogen-challenged neighbours through CMNs to activate defence responses and increase their disease resistance against potential pathogen

## Synopsis

### Introduction
Plants are challenged by a wide variety of pathogens and pests
In response they have developed effective defence systems against these agents based on a combination of constitutive defences as well as induced defences expressed only after an initial signal that invaders are present [^1],[^2],[^3].
Many species can increase their defence levels by responding to chemical signals from neighbours that are being attacked by herbivores or pathogens [^6],[^7],[^8],[^9],[^10],[^11],[^12],[^13].
When a plant attacked by herbivores emits signals, the neighbouring plants anticipate imminent damage and take timely measure by direct defence; by increasing levels of toxins and repellents [^14], or by indirect defence, attracting natural enemies [^15],[^16].
Communication via volatile signals, is subject to the vagaries of atmospheric conditions

### Methods
Jin Bao) were surface-sterilized with 10% H2O2 and rinsed five times with sterile distilled water before sowing in autoclaved quartz sand.
After 10 d the seedlings were utilized for the experiment.
The starting inocula of mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae
& Gerd) Gerdemann & Trappe BEG 167 used in this experiment, were kindly provided by Prof.
The mycorrhizal inoculum was produced in pot culture using corn (Zea mays L.) plants and autoclaved sand media [^56].
A mixture of rhizospheric sand containing spores, mycelium and colonized plant roots from trap cultures (Z. mays) with 35 infective propagules per gram was used for mycorrhizal inoculation

### Results
Six defence-related enzymes, including peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), chitinase, b-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and lipoxygenase (LOX), in the leaves of neighbouring ‘receiver’ plant were analyzed.
The activity of POD was significantly higher in healthy tomato plants that were connected by the G. mosseae CMNs with the pathogen-challenged tomato plants (Fig 1a).
The POD activity in ‘receiver’ plants of treatment A was, on average, higher by 81.0, 74.1 and 122.6% than that of treatment B, C and D, respectively at 65 h after pathogen inoculation of ‘donor’ plants.
Upon pathogen challenge in ‘donor’ plants, chitinase activity in the healthy ‘receiver’ plants in treatment A was significantly higher 65 h after the pathogen inoculation (Fig 1c).
The chitinase activity displayed increases of 51.6, 27.6 and 27.6%, respectively in the healthy ‘receiver’ plants of treatment A compared to those in treatment B, C and D at 65 h after pathogen inoculation

### Conclusion
The authors demonstrate that CMNs can serve as underground communication conduit transferring defence signals and disease resistance between healthy and pathogen-infected neighbouring plants.
The authors excluded volatile communication by covering the infected ‘donor’ plant with an air-tight plastic bag after pathogen inoculation.
The authors excluded the belowground communication by root exudates in treatment B by growing tomato plants without mycorrhiza but the neighbouring ‘donor’ plants being pathogen-infected.
If root exudates mediate plant-plant communication, induced defence responses could be detected in ‘receiver’ plants in treatment B.
The authors found the highest disease incidence and severity of ‘receiver’ plants in treatment B among the four treatments (Table 1), suggesting that no induced defence occurred when the two plants were not connected with CMNs


## Study subjects

### 6 defence-related genes
- After establishment of CMNs with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae between tomato plants, inoculation of ‘donor’ plants with the pathogen Alternaria solani led to increases in disease resistance and activities of the putative defensive enzymes, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, chitinase, b-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and lipoxygenase in healthy neighbouring ‘receiver’ plants. ==The uninfected ‘receiver’ plants also activated six defence-related genes when CMNs connected ‘donor’ plants challenged with A. solani==. This finding indicates that CMNs may function as a plant-plant underground communication conduit whereby disease resistance and induced defence signals can be transferred between the healthy and pathogen-infected neighbouring plants, suggesting that plants can ‘eavesdrop’ on defence signals from the pathogen-challenged neighbours through CMNs to activate defences before being attacked themselves

### 6 defence genes
- Although mycorrhization in the healthy ‘receiver’ plants led to some increase in LOX in treatment C and D, LOX induction was more pronounced in the presence of CMNs connection with pathogen-challenged neighbours. ==In the ‘receiver’ plant leaves, we used quantitative real time RTPCR to detect the transcripts of six defence genes: genes encoding the pathogen-related proteins (PR1), basic type PR-2 (b-1,3glucanase) and PR-3 (chitinase); phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in the phenylpropanoid pathway; LOX and allene oxide cyclase (AOC), which are two key enzymes of the jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway==. The ‘receiver’ tomato plants greatly increased the expression of all six defence-related genes when connected with pathogen-challenged neighbouring plants via CMNs (Fig 2)

### 6 defence-related genes
- In the ‘receiver’ plant leaves, we used quantitative real time RTPCR to detect the transcripts of six defence genes: genes encoding the pathogen-related proteins (PR1), basic type PR-2 (b-1,3glucanase) and PR-3 (chitinase); phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in the phenylpropanoid pathway; LOX and allene oxide cyclase (AOC), which are two key enzymes of the jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway. ==The ‘receiver’ tomato plants greatly increased the expression of all six defence-related genes when connected with pathogen-challenged neighbouring plants via CMNs (Fig 2)==. PR1 transcripts in the ‘receiver’ plants in treatment A were upregulated 11.1, 9.3 and 23.0-fold at 65, 100 and 140 h after pathogen inoculation, respectively in comparison to those in treatment B, which did not have CMN connections with pathogen-challenged neighbouring plants (Fig 2a)

## Data analysis
- #method/ANOVA
- #method/tukey_post_hoc_test
- #method/analysis_of_variance

## Findings
- Approximate 80% of terrestrial plants establish mutualistic mycorrhizae with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, phylum Glomeromycota), which play a vital role in soil fertility and plant nutrition [^17]

##  Builds on previous research
- To test whether this induced defence by CMN interplant communication can enhance tomato resistance to early blight disease, ‘receiver’ plants in four treatments were inoculated with A. solani after CMNs had been established and 65 h after ‘donor plant’ had been inoculated with A. solani. Although mycorrhizal formation enhanced tomato resistance to leaf disease by A. solani, ==consistent with the other findings== [^21], pathogen-challenged neighbouring plants further increased plant resistance to early blight when they were connected by CMNs (Table 1)
- Colonization of tomato roots by G. mossae systemically protects the plant against infection by Phytophthora parasitica through priming [^54]. ==Our study showed that mycorrhizal inoculation itself did not affect most enzyme activities tested== (Fig 1) and only had marginal effects on transcripts of defence-related genes (Fig 2)

## Differs from previous work
- In plants, recognition of a potential invader through the detection of signal molecules is a requirement to initiate an effective defence response [^43]. ==However, our tested tomato plants were neither challenged by a pathogen nor contacted with volatile signals from ‘donor’ plants==
- Our study showed that mycorrhizal inoculation itself did not affect most enzyme activities tested (Fig 1) and only had marginal effects on transcripts of defence-related genes (Fig 2). ==However==, pre-inoculation of tomato with AMF primed defence responses in ‘donor’ plants after pathogen attack [^42]

## Future work
- Further experiments with plants grown under axenic conditions should be performed to exclude possible mycorrhizal effects on soil microflora multiplication and to confirm our findings under more controlled experimental conditions. It is important to determine the expression pattern of those house-keeping genes, which are not expected to be affected by pathogen infection, when investigating the expression levels of defense genes in response to communication with pathogen-challenged neighbours through CMNs. Such genes should have the same expression levels in all treatments and should not be affected by the treatments with or without mycorrhizal networks.
- Further study is required to determine the exact signal compounds transferring through AMF networks.
- Further studies on plant-plant communication will promote our understanding of systemic defence in natural ecosystems, which in turn may provide clues to manipulate plant defences in agroecosystems.
