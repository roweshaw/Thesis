## Abstract
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (order Glomales), which form mycorrhizal symbioses with two out of three of all plant species[^1], are believed to be obligate biotrophs that are wholly dependent on the plant partner for their carbon supply[^2]. ==It is thought that they possess no degradative capability== and that they are unable to decompose complex organic molecules, the form in which most soil nutrients occur. ==Earlier suggestions that they could exist saprotrophically were based on observation of hyphal proliferation== on organic materials[^3],[^4]. In contrast, other mycorrhizal types have been shown to acquire nitrogen directly from organic sources5±7. Here ==we show that the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis can both enhance decomposition== of and increase nitrogen capture from complex organic material (grass leaves) in soil. ==Hyphal growth of the fungal partner was increased in the presence of the organic material==, independently of the host plant.

## Key points
- Letters to nature separation was by a 0.45-mm mesh, through which hyphae cannot normally pass but which allows solute diffusion to occur
- Where mobile ions such as NO-3 or NH+4 are being produced in decomposing patches of organic material, the ability of the ®ne hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to penetrate into the material and to compete with other microbes could lead to increased N acquisition by the plant
- Decomposition of the experimental patch was faster than the control: after 28 and 42 days the mean 13C content of the experimental patch samples was 0.21 6 0.08 mg g-1 soil compared with 0.56 6 0.11 mg g-1 for the controls (F1,16 = 8.24; P = 0.011), representing 4% and 11% retention, respectively. 15N content showed a similar pattern (F1,16 = 5.23; P = 0.036) with 12% and 21% retention
- The microbial community as described by the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) pro®le was unaffected by treatment
- The preferential growth of hyphae into the organic patch rather than into the uninoculated plant compartment was unexpected: if the fungus acquires all its carbon (C) from plant hosts, it might be expected to bene®t from maximizing the number of hosts it colonizes, which in this case would result in preferential growth into the uninoculated plant compartment
- At the ®nal collection (42 days) roots from two of the plants in the control row had entered the patch by breaking through the adhesive that sealed the barrier between compartments to the box; the mesh was intact in all cases

## Synopsis
Letters to nature separation was by a 0.45-mm mesh, through which hyphae cannot normally pass but which allows solute diffusion to occur.
Where mobile ions such as NO-3 or NH+4 are being produced in decomposing patches of organic material, the ability of the ®ne hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to penetrate into the material and to compete with other microbes could lead to increased N acquisition by the plant.
The authors tested the hypothesis that plant N uptake would be increased by giving the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae access to a decomposing patch of organic matter from which roots were excluded.
Each microcosm comprised two rows of three compartments, four of which contained a single plant and two a patch of dual-labelled (15N/13C) Lolium perenne leaves containing 1.7 mg 15N and 5.0 mg 13C.
The increased rate of decomposition was not due to qualitative changes in the microbial community caused by the fungi, but was probably a direct result of the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae.
The hyphae of G. hoi proliferated extensively within both the inoculated plant compartment and the experimental patch compartment (Fig. 2a), eventually reaching a similar density in each.
After 42 days there was less hyphal growth into the compartment that contained the uninoculated plant (Fig. 2a), and there was no difference between experimental and control rows in that compartment (Fig. 2b).
Experimental plants were no different from controls in their dry weight, N content or N concentration, they captured three times as much patch N (15 6 1.9%) as control plants (5 6 1.2%; Fig. 3a).
The discovery that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae may preferentially colonize organic patches rather than new host plants is surprising, even though an association between hyphal growth and organic matter is long established[^3].
The two middle compartments of the microcosm unit each received 100 g inoculum of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus G. hoi as colonized roots of P. lanceolata in a sand and Terra-Green growth medium.
At the ®nal collection (42 days) roots from two of the plants in the control row had entered the patch by breaking through the adhesive that sealed the barrier between compartments to the box; the mesh was intact in all cases.
There were no signi®cant differences in shoot, root or total dry weights between inoculated control and experimental plants and the uninoculated control and experimental plants.
Root and soil samples from the unplanted compartments were dried (70 8C; 48 h) and milled in a ball mill to a ®ne powder for analysis by mass spectrometry performed on a continuous- ̄ow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS).

## Findings
- Decomposition of the experimental patch was faster than the control: after 28 and 42 days (with no difference between these two sampling times) the mean 13C content of the experimental patch samples was 0.21 6 0.08 mg g-1 soil compared with 0.56 6 0.11 mg g-1 for the controls (F1,16 = 8.24; P = 0.011), representing 4% and 11% retention, respectively. 15N content showed a similar pattern (F1,16 = 5.23; P = 0.036) with 12% (experimental) and 21% (control) retention
