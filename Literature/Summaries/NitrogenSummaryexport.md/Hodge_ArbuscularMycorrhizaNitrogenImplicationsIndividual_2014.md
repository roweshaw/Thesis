## Abstract
Background Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form mutualistic symbioses with c. two-thirds of all land plants. Traditionally, it was thought that they played no role in nitrogen (N) acquisition for their host, despite early evidence to the contrary. More recently, this perception has changed radically, with the demonstration that AMF can acquire N from both inorganic and organic N sources and transfer some of this N to their host plant. ==Scope This review discusses the current evidence for AMF N uptake, transport and plant transfer under different experimental conditions and highlights key questions== that remain to be resolved. ==The relevance of this AMF N acquisition pathway is discussed both in relation to host plant and fungal N nutrition==. The importance of interactions with the soil community and subsequent implications for soil N cycling are also highlighted. Conclusions Reported AMF contribution to plant N varies widely, but the reasons for this variability are unclear. In low N systems even small amounts of ‘extra’ N may confer the plant with a competitive advantage, but it is also likely that competition for N between symbionts occurs. To advance this area, a more mechanistic approach is required that treats the

## Key points
- The arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis is the most common type of mycorrhizal association and forms between soil fungi in the phylum Glomeromycota and c. two-thirds of all land plant species
- While following community changes is more informative than reporting %RLC data, we need to focus much more upon the functional importance of these altered Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities, both from a fungal as well as a plant nutritional view. While it has been demonstrated under controlled conditions that AMF can transfer N to their host plant (Leigh et al 2009; [^Herman_et+al_2012_a]), and that reduced N fertiliser additions can result in higher plant percentage N derived from fertiliser in AM plants ([^Azcón_et+al_2008_a]), the evidence for this occurring under field systems is limited
- There is much current interest in moving towards sustainable agricultural systems, and AMF with their range of potential benefits are often viewed as prime candidates to aid this goal
- While it has been shown that AMF can acquire inorganic
- While most studies suggest that NH4+ is the ‘preferred’ N source for AMF, it may transpire that different AMF species have different N preferences, just as different plant species do
- Positive interactions between AMF and N fixation are well established and likely are due to AMF reducing P stress, as well as increased micronutrient supply (Smith and Read 2008). Using such experimental systems, N flow between interconnected plants has been demonstrated, with values ranging from 0.1 to 80% of one-way N transfer from the N-fixing mycorrhizal to the non-N-fixing mycorrhizal plant; several studies report values of less than 10% (9 out of the 19 cases reported by [^He_et+al_2009_a])
- The fact that different plants can be connected via different AMF does further complicate the picture, but advances in modelling, genomics and metabolomic techniques offer the potential to gain new insights into this most ancient of symbioses, with the goal of exploiting this knowledge in the field

## Synopsis
The arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis is the most common type of mycorrhizal association and forms between soil fungi in the phylum Glomeromycota and c. two-thirds of all land plant species.
Comparisons among studies are further complicated by the possibility that the AMF may be acquiring and transferring N to the plant from sources other than the added 15N labelled source depending on the growth media used in the compartments, potentially resulting in a underestimate of the total AMF contribution to host plant N.
The demonstration that even root proliferation increased N acquisition from such organic materials when in interspecific plant competition, together with the key role that AMF play in plant nutrition and plant community structure, suggested it was time to re-examine whether AMF could acquire and transfer, N from organic material patches to their host plant.
A further striking result in the study by Hodge et al (2001) was that in the presence of AMF, decomposition of the organic material was enhanced as indicated by the lower 15N and 13C recovered from the patches on the experimental, compared to control, side of the microcosm unit.
The mechanism behind the latter result is unclear given when protozoa were added to the hyphal compartment this did not further enhance AMF N transfer from the organic material to the plant, but does suggest interactions between AMF and other soil organisms may influence the outcome for the plant.
While it has been demonstrated under controlled conditions that AMF can transfer N to their host plant (Leigh et al 2009; [^Herman_et+al_2012_a]), and that reduced N fertiliser additions can result in higher plant percentage N derived from fertiliser in AM plants ([^Azcón_et+al_2008_a]), the evidence for this occurring under field systems is limited.
Results from studies that use Benomyl can be complex to interpret as the ‘non-AM’ treatments are often still slightly AM (e.g. [^Blanke_et+al_2011_a]; [^Veresoglou_et+al_2011_a]), the fungicide itself and dying hyphae can be additional C and N inputs (Chen et al 2001) which can fuel mineralisation and other N cycling processes in soils, while non-target effects on other saprotrophic fungi further complicates the interpretation of such experiments ([^Hodge_2013_a]).
The fact that different plants can be connected via different AMF does further complicate the picture, but advances in modelling, genomics and metabolomic techniques offer the potential to gain new insights into this most ancient of symbioses, with the goal of exploiting this knowledge in the field


## Study subjects

### 19 cases
- Positive interactions between AMF and N fixation are well established and likely are due to AMF reducing P stress, as well as increased micronutrient supply (Smith and Read 2008). ==Nevertheless, using such experimental systems, N flow between interconnected plants has been demonstrated, with values ranging from 0.1 to 80% of one-way N transfer from the N-fixing mycorrhizal to the non-N-fixing mycorrhizal plant; although several studies report values of less than 10% (9 out of the 19 cases reported by [^He_et+al_2009_a]</a>)==. In some cases, N has also been reported to flow in the other direction, but values are much lower; generally less than 10% of the N transferred ([^He_et+al_2009_a]</a>)

## Data analysis
- #method/pearson

## Findings
- In some cases this approach has resulted in values greater than 100% ‘intact’ organic N uptake being reported ([^Weigelt_et+al_2003_a]; [^Nordin_et+al_2001_a]), which has led to questions over the validity of the technique (see [^Jones_et+al_2005_a]), including the possibility that 13C fragments (rather than intact amino acid) are being taken up by the plant (see [^Rasmussen_et+al_2010_a])
- Furthermore, although plant roots can take up amino acids ([^Hill_et+al_2011_a]), of the studies in Table 1 that used 13C:15N dual-labelled organic substrates, 13C levels in the plant were never above background levels, except for when glycine was added in the study by [^Hodge_2001_a]), but even here the amount of C from the glycine detected in the plants was less than 1% of the C originally added
- As the data on Table 2 demonstrates, the contribution of AMF to total plant N content is generally less than 7%, with the exception of the study by Leigh et al (2009) where the AMF contributed more substantially to the host plants N status (13–22% depending on the AMF species); even in that case, however, plant biomass was not enhanced
- Positive interactions between AMF and N fixation are well established and likely are due to AMF reducing P stress, as well as increased micronutrient supply (Smith and Read 2008). Using such experimental systems, N flow between interconnected plants has been demonstrated, with values ranging from 0.1 to 80% of one-way N transfer from the N-fixing mycorrhizal to the non-N-fixing mycorrhizal plant; although several studies report values of less than 10% (9 out of the 19 cases reported by [^He_et+al_2009_a])
- In some cases, N has also been reported to flow in the other direction, but values are much lower; generally less than 10% of the N transferred ([^He_et+al_2009_a])

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- As plants are no longer C or N limited, they require more P, subsequently increasing the C supply to their AMF partners in exchange for P ([^Antoninka_et+al_2011_a]; [^Garcia_et+al_2008_a]). ==These results appear to support the suggestion that if a plant is limited by N or P then it will increase C allocation to its associated AMF==, while at intermediate levels of both N and P, C allocation will be reduced ([^Johnson_et+al_2003_a]</a>; [^Treseder_2002_a]</a></a>)

## Counterpoint to earlier claims
- Moreover, the majority of the studies on Table 1 have been conducted under low N conditions, which may have resulted in increased competition between the plant and fungal symbionts for the N available, and may explain why root proliferation still occurred; whether the plant actually restricted AMF proliferation however, remains to be determined. ==Furthermore, although plant roots can take up amino acids ([^Hill_et+al_2011_a]), of the studies in Table 1 that used 13C:15N dual-labelled organic substrates, 13C levels in the plant were never above background levels, except for when glycine was added in the study by [^Hodge_2001_a]), but even here the amount of C from the glycine detected in the plants was less than 1% of the C originally added==
- A reduction in the number of denitrifiers present in the mycorrhizosphere soil was found by [^Amora-Lazcano_et+al_1998_a]), and was linked to a reduced C input. Similarly, AMF were suggested to suppress ammonia oxidisers by [^Veresoglou_et+al_2011_a]) ==whereas other studies have shown an increase== ([^Amora-Lazcano_et+al_1998_a]</a>) or no change (Cavagnaro et al 2007) in ammonia oxidising bacterial numbers in the presence of AM roots

## Contributions
- Reported AMF contribution to plant N varies widely, but the reasons for this variability are unclear. In low N systems even small amounts of ‘extra’ N may confer the plant with a competitive advantage, but it is also likely that competition for N between symbionts occurs.

Previous suggestions that AMF may be saprotrophic because of their ability to proliferate in organic materials (see Hepper and Warner 1983; Warner and Mosse 1980), however, are not supported by more recent evidence: under gnotobiotic conditions AMF colonisation failed to enhance root N capture from a range of organic materials of varying complexity (Leigh et al. 2011). At present, AMF have no known saprotrophic capability (see Smith and Read [[decomposition_DecompositionRecentOrganicMatterAdditions_2011]] [OA](https://api.scholarcy.com/oa_version?query=decomposition%20of%20recent%20organic%20matter%20additions%20but%20also%20that%20of%20soil%20organic%20carbon%20although%20the%20effect%20depended%20upon%20N%20availability%20Previous%20suggestions%20that%20AMF%20may%20be%20saprotrophic%20because%20of%20their%20ability%20to%20proliferate%20in%20organic%20materials%20see%20Hepper%20and%20Warner%201983%20Warner%20and%20Mosse%201980%20however%20are%20not%20supported%20by%20more%20recent%20evidence%20under%20gnotobiotic%20conditions%20AMF%20colonisation%20failed%20to%20enhance%20root%20N%20capture%20from%20a%20range%20of%20organic%20materials%20of%20varying%20complexity%20Leigh%20et%20al%202011%20At%20present%20AMF%20have%20no%20known%20saprotrophic%20capability%20see%20Smith%20and%20Read) [GScholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=decomposition%20of%20recent%20organic%20matter%20additions%20but%20also%20that%20of%20soil%20organic%20carbon%20although%20the%20effect%20depended%20upon%20N%20availability%20Previous%20suggestions%20that%20AMF%20may%20be%20saprotrophic%20because%20of%20their%20ability%20to%20proliferate%20in%20organic%20materials%20see%20Hepper%20and%20Warner%201983%20Warner%20and%20Mosse%201980%20however%20are%20not%20supported%20by%20more%20recent%20evidence%20under%20gnotobiotic%20conditions%20AMF%20colonisation%20failed%20to%20enhance%20root%20N%20capture%20from%20a%20range%20of%20organic%20materials%20of%20varying%20complexity%20Leigh%20et%20al%202011%20At%20present%20AMF%20have%20no%20known%20saprotrophic%20capability%20see%20Smith%20and%20Read) [Scite](https://api.scholarcy.com/scite_url?query=decomposition%20of%20recent%20organic%20matter%20additions%20but%20also%20that%20of%20soil%20organic%20carbon%20although%20the%20effect%20depended%20upon%20N%20availability%20Previous%20suggestions%20that%20AMF%20may%20be%20saprotrophic%20because%20of%20their%20ability%20to%20proliferate%20in%20organic%20materials%20see%20Hepper%20and%20Warner%201983%20Warner%20and%20Mosse%201980%20however%20are%20not%20supported%20by%20more%20recent%20evidence%20under%20gnotobiotic%20conditions%20AMF%20colonisation%20failed%20to%20enhance%20root%20N%20capture%20from%20a%20range%20of%20organic%20materials%20of%20varying%20complexity%20Leigh%20et%20al%202011%20At%20present%20AMF%20have%20no%20known%20saprotrophic%20capability%20see%20Smith%20and%20Read)

[^)._1995_a]: 2008). This contrasts with fungi involved in the ectoand ericoid mycorrhizal associations where saprotrophic capability has been demonstrated although such capabilities are often highly variable among fungal species, and even isolates, screened (see Read and Perez-Moreno 2003; Hodge et al. 1995). Thus, if the AMF are not decomposing the organic material directly themselves, they must be enhancing the other decomposers present in the organic patch suggesting interactions with other soil microorganisms ultimately determine the N available for the AMF.
