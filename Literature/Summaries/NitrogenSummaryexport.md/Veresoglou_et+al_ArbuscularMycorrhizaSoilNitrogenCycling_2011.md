## Abstract
Nitrogen is a major nutrient that frequently limits primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, the physiological responses of plants to soil nitrogen (N) availability have been extensively investigated, and the study of the soil N-cycle has become an important component of ecosystem ecology and biogeochemistry. The bulk of the literature in these areas has, however, overlooked the fact that most plants form mycorrhizal associations, and that nutrient uptake is therefore mediated by mycorrhizal fungi. It is well established that ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizas influence N nutrition of plants, but roles of arbuscular mycorrhizas in N nutrition are less well established; perhaps even more importantly, current conceptual models ignore possible influences of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on N-cycling processes. ==We review evidence for the interaction between the AM symbiosis with microbes and processes involved in soil N-cycling==. ==We show that to date investigations have rather poorly addressed such interactions and discuss possible reasons for this==. We outline mechanisms that could potentially operate with regards to AM fungal e N-cycling interactions, discuss experimental designs aimed at studying these, and conclude by pointing out priorities for future research.

## Synopsis

### Introduction
There are several reasons that justify the extensive attention of the scientific community on the nitrogen (N) cycle.
N is one of the few nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems that may limit growth of both plants ([^Chapin_et+al_2004_a]) and microbial communities
N-limitation of the microbial and especially the plant community is characteristic of ecosystems developing on newly formed soil substrate ([^Vitousek_2004_a]; [^Lambers_et+al_2008_a]) and has strong implications to the establishment of vegetation in such areas.
AM fungi are obligate symbionts and obtain all their organic carbon (C) requirements from their plant partners
In consequence their activities are not limited by organic C substrates in soil, as is the case for many free-living microbes including those involved in nutrient cycling.
The authors conclude with potential solutions to experimental issues and make suggestions for prioritizing future research

### Substrate availability
An obvious pathway via which the AM status of plants could exert an influence on N-cycling processes is via substrate availability in soil (Fig. 1).
AM fungi may reduce availability of substrates for free-living N-cycling microbiota through immobilization of inorganic N into their mycelium or transfer of nutrients to their host.
They may reduce ammonium (NHþ4 ) levels in the soil
[^Govindarajulu_et+al_2005_a]; Fig. 1) and potentially limit denitrification and N leaching.
Mobility and availability of N-compounds is known to be regulated by several abiotic factors such as pH ([^Marschner_1995_a]), as discussed

### Modification of the abiotic soil environment
There have been a number of reviews on AM-mediated effects on soil aggregation showing improvement of soil aggregation in the mycorrhizosphere (e.g. [^Tisdall_1982_a]; [^Miller_2002_a]; [^Rillig_2006_a]).
There have been a number of reviews on AM-mediated effects on soil aggregation showing improvement of soil aggregation in the mycorrhizosphere
Modification of soil aggregation (Fig. 1) affects aeration of soil, and this could have an impact on nitrification and denitrification, the two N-cycling processes that are affected by oxygen concentration in the soil air.
[^Li_et+al_1991_a]; [^Bago_et+al_1996_a]; [^Marschner_2003_a]), and modify availability of N-compounds
Modification of carbon content of the soil could mediate changes in soil properties such as water holding capacity
[^Bouyoucos_1939_a]) and influence moisture-sensitive N-cycling processes such as nitrification
Modification of carbon content of the soil could mediate changes in soil properties such as water holding capacity (e.g. [^Bouyoucos_1939_a]) and influence moisture-sensitive N-cycling processes such as nitrification (e.g. [^Avrahami_2007_a]), denitrification (e.g. [^Davidson_et+al_1993_a]) and leaching (e.g. [^Currie_1997_a])

### Microbial community shifts
Changes in resources and abiotic conditions as well as generation of specialized niches in the hyphosphere and potential allelopathic interactions could result in AM-mediated shifts in microbial communities (e.g. [^Marschner_et+al_2001_a]</a>).
Changes in resources and abiotic conditions as well as generation of specialized niches in the hyphosphere and potential allelopathic interactions could result in AM-mediated shifts in microbial communities
Increasing evidence over the last few years reveals that AM fungi have the ability to modify the microbial community in the rhizosphere
[^Marschner_et+al_2001_a]</a>; Rillig.
Specific groups of microbes such as bacteria of the genus Azospirillum and some species of Pseudomonas
N-cycling processes could be affected directly, through modification of densities of microbes directly related to N-cycling processes such as Azospirillum spp.
(e.g. Vázquez et al, 2000) or indirectly through shifts in the intensity of competition for exudates
Direct allelochemical suppression of microbes by AM fungal hyphae is a theoretical possibility, no evidence for this exists

### Individual host plant level effects
The outcome of colonization of plants with AM fungi is commonly an increase in their size ([^Lekberg_2005_a]; [^Hoeksema_et+al_2010_a]</a>).
Some experimental procedures such as sterilization may have contributed to these observed effects on plant growth
[^Brinkman_et+al_2010_a]; [^Hoeksema_et+al_2010_a]</a>), the authors have no reason to believe that AM fungi do not induce an increase in plant size that could include a bigger root system.
Spatial extension of the rhizosphere, a well known “hot spot” of microbial activity ([^Nannipieri_et+al_2003_a]), means that N-cycling processes may occur in a larger soil volume (Fig. 1).
[^Jackson_et+al_1996_a]), and an AM-induced increase in root size at these depths could stimulate N-cycling processes
Despite the high overlap of plant roots in the surface soil, root exploitation of soils becomes less intense deeper in the soil profile (e.g. [^Jackson_et+al_1996_a]), and an AM-induced increase in root size at these depths could stimulate N-cycling processes

### Plant community level shifts
The AM fungal community can induce plant community shifts (e.g. [^van_der_Heijden_et+al_1998_a]; [^Landis_et+al_2005_a]; [^Wolfe_et+al_2006_a]).
[^van_der_Heijden_et+al_1998_a]; [^Landis_et+al_2005_a]; [^Wolfe_et+al_2006_a])
This raises the question whether these shifts could lead to changes in N-cycling processes (Fig. 1).
Collins and Foster (2009) were able to establish AM-free and AM-inoculated mesocosms of adequate size to address community shifts in abundance of grasses
Their targeted experimentation revealed a decline in abundance of C4 grasses in the AM-free mesocosms with a concomitant increase of C3 grasses ([^Collins_2009_a]).
This shift may be one example of a more generalized change toward plants that respond positively in terms of growth.
Litter quality is known to be a key trait that affects N-mineralization ([^van_der_Krift_2001_a]) and other N-cycling processes such as nitrification ([^Booth_et+al_2005_a])

### N-uptake and N-mineralization
Abovementioned studies have revealed that the N mobilized from patches can account for up to 32% of the total N present in the patch ([^Leigh_et+al_2009_a]</a>), that N mobilization is possible at temperatures close to 10 C ([^Barrett_et+al_2011_a]</a>) and that N mobilization may take place even when an AM fungus fails to stimulate plant growth ([^Hodge_2010_a]</a></a>)
It is striking, that the vast majority of studies that addressed the ability of AM fungi to facilitate N acquisition have targeted AM fungal isolates in the Glomeraceae.
Thereby, the authors believe that more targeted experimentation is required with regards to the fate of the patch following AM colonization, as well as the ability of the surrounding community to assimilate the label in the presence and absence of AM fungal extraradical hyphae

### Mechanisms of AM fungal involvement
Identification of AM fungal genes related to primary N nutrition such as glutamine synthetases and some nitrate reductases ([^Govindarajulu_et+al_2005_a]; [^Tian_et+al_2010_a]) suggested that extraradical hyphae of AM fungi have the ability to assimilate N in the forms of NHþ4 and, possibly NOÀ3.
[^Johansen_et+al_1992_a]) could be attributed either to their more thorough colonization of the soil environment or to an improved ability to assimilate inorganic N through efficient high-affinity NHþ4 and NOÀ3 transporters.
The fate of the organic skeleton of Arg following N transfer, whether the AM fungus is able to recapture the carbon and how, remains an issue
It is not known, as noted by [^Fitter_et+al_2011_a]), if mycorrhizal plants are able to down-regulate plant N- transporters in a way similar to P transporters ([^Bucher_2007_a]; [^Javot_et+al_2007_a]).
There appears to be no evidence that AM fungi contribute to N-mineralization directly through secretion of N-mineralization enzymes
They may exert indirect effects through modifying the microbial community so that the degradation ability of organic matter is enhanced
The contribution of bacteria to the decomposition of complex substrates is believed to be more limited than that of fungi (e.g. [^de_Boer_et+al_2005_a]) and possibly any modification of the bacterial community following AM colonization would be of minor importance

### N2-fixation
Co-inoculation of legumes with AM fungi results in increases in their N-fixing ability
The high P requirements of nitrogenase ([^Puppi_et+al_1994_a]), could mask any competitive interactions and allow an increase in the N-fixing ability of Rhizobia following association with AM fungi as a result of improved P nutrition.
Qualitative modification of exudates following AM colonization is believed to involve a decline in total sugars and an increase in release of N-rich compounds ([^Jones_et+al_2004_a])
Both changes could intensify carbon limitation of rhizosphere microbes and diminish the potential advantage of N-fixers over other microbes.
The non-symbiotic N-fixing microbial community may not be very responsive to AM-induced changes

### Nitrification
Mechanisms of AM fungal involvement As autotrophic organisms, ammonia oxidizers (AO) are not directly affected by AM-colonization related changes in rhizodeposition or carbon-substrate related hyphosphere effects, at least compared to the direct effects on heterotrophic soil microbiota.
With regards to interspecific competition for nutrients other than C and N, dependence of the competing microbial community on plant derived C could generate favorable conditions for ammonia oxidizer proliferation in the mycorrhizosphere through the decline in sugar exudation that follows AM colonization ([^Jones_et+al_2004_a]).
A suppression of the competing microbial community could, be detrimental if N-mineralization rates are affected and NHþ4 -substrate availability declines.
A final mechanism could be an indirect AM-mediated effect on nitrification through altered root structure.
In both scenarios the outcome of the altered root structure is an acceleration of N-cycling

### Denitrification
[^Amora-Lazcano_et+al_1998_a]) were able to demonstrate a decrease in counts of denitrifying bacteria in the presence of AM fungi
Their harvesting technique could have affected carbon availability in the microcosms through severing roots, impacting denitrification rates.
Modification of carbon availability away from the root, in the hyphosphere, through hyphal exudation ([^Toljander_et+al_2007_a]) and the resulting shifts in the microbial community in this zone ([^Toljander_et+al_2006_a]) could be factors that might promote denitrification it is not possible to predict the exact effect of AM colonization on the denitrifying community, primarily because of the remarkable physiological flexibility of denitrifiers, mentioned above

### N-Leaching
Improvement of soil structure in the AM mycorrhizosphere ([^Rillig_2006_a]) and possibly water held in the hyphae could result in an increase of the water holding capacity of soil
In support of these ideas, [^van_der_Heijden_2010_a]) detected a trend toward lower leachate volumes, in the presence of the AM community, for all six AM vs non-mycorrhizal contrasts he established.
To study the AM-associated changes the most common approach is to use compartmented systems with the incorporation of fine meshes that permit access only to hyphae, excluding roots
Following such a procedure, it is often speculated that soil that has not been in the reach of the roots represents the hyphosphere.
Through the use of these techniques, it is possible to simultaneously and explicitly examine direct and indirect effects

### Conclusions
The authors have shown that the amount of available evidence on the potential effects of AM fungi on individual N-cycling processes varies considerably.
Despite the wealth of studies that have addressed the interactive effect of AM fungi on N-assimilation the ecological significance of the process ([^Smith_2011_a]) as well as the conditions under which the role of AM fungi may be important ([^Fitter_et+al_2011_a]) are still not well understood.
Many open questions that could guide future research remain: (i) what is the relative importance of the AM fungal influence, i.e. when should mycorrhiza be considered and when is it safe to ignore them; (ii) what is the role of diversity of AM fungi, given that there are tendencies within the phylum Glomeromycota for diverging functions ([^Powell_et+al_2011_a]); (iii) how can the study of AM impact be focused on isolated N-cycling processes given the high interdependence of N-cycling processes; (iv) what is the relative importance of direct AM-induced effects compared to more general AM-mediated plant and microbial community effects on N-cycling processes.
The authors hope to have stimulated soil microbial ecologists and mycorrhizal biologists to tackle some of these important issues


## Study subjects

### 3 studies
- 3.3.1. ==Evidence for AM fungal involvement Available literature for impacts of AM on nitrification is limited to three studies==. [^Amora-Lazcano_et+al_1998_a]) observed that inoculation of maize with G. mosseae and Glomus fasciculatum facilitated establishment of culturable ammonia oxidizing bacteria in the soil

### 3 plant species
- 3.5.1. ==Evidence for AM fungal involvement The role of AM fungi in leaching has not been extensively studied. [^van_der_Heijden_2010_a]) used three plant species tested at two nutrient supply rates==. He was able to demonstrate significant differences in the composition of the leachate with respect to phosphate concentration for all three plants at the low nutrient supply; also with respect to NHþ4 for Festuca ovina at the low nutrient supply and for Poa pratensis at the high nutrient supply

## Findings
- Abovementioned studies have revealed that the N mobilized from patches can account for up to 32% of the total N present in the patch ([^Leigh_et+al_2009_a]), that N mobilization is possible at temperatures close to 10 C ([^Barrett_et+al_2011_a]) and that N mobilization may take place even when an AM fungus fails to stimulate plant growth ([^Hodge_2010_a])

## Counterpoint to earlier claims
- Given the absence of differences in the size of the plants in the experiment of [^van_der_Heijden_2010_a]</a>), these results signify that AM fungi may represent an effective way to limit N-losses from an ecosystem. [^Asghari_2011_a]) were, also, able to detect a decline in NOÀ3 , NHþ4 , and phosphate concentrations in the leachate, which, however, could partly be attributed to the bigger size of the mycorrhizal plants. By contrast, [^Rillig_et+al_2006_b]) studied leaching of DOC/DON components that may be ==related to AMF, but detected no measurable amounts of a putatively AMFderived protein; this study only targeted glomalin-related soil protein==, and thus it cannot be used as exhaustive evidence against the occurrence of AM fungal derived N-compounds in leachate

## Contributions
- We have shown that the amount of available evidence on the potential effects of AM fungi on individual N-cycling processes varies considerably. The majority of studies on the interactive effect of AM and the N-cycle unsurprisingly focuses on economically/ agriculturally important aspects of the N-cycle such as the ability of plants to assimilate N and symbiotic N2-fixation. Yet despite the wealth of studies that have addressed the interactive effect of AM fungi on N-assimilation the ecological significance of the process ([^Smith_2011_a]) as well as the conditions under which the role of AM fungi may be important ([^Fitter_et+al_2011_a]) are still not well understood. There appears to be solid evidence that AM fungi do contribute to an increased ability of legumes to fix N2 and also to a decline in the amount of inorganic N that leaches. By contrast, literature available to date does not allow us to reach a definitive conclusion whether there is also an AM effect on associative nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification, despite the fact that plausible mechanisms exist for these effects. Taken together, there is a high likelihood that AM fungi play a role as drivers of N-cycling, which has not been appreciated hitherto.

## Future work
- We show that to date investigations have rather poorly addressed such interactions and discuss possible reasons for this. We outline mechanisms that could potentially operate with regards to AM fungal e N-cycling interactions, discuss experimental designs aimed at studying these, and conclude by pointing out priorities for future research.
- We analyze mechanisms relevant to main N-cycling processes. We conclude with potential solutions to experimental issues and make suggestions for prioritizing future research.
- As a result, our understanding of microbial communities in the rhizosphere of plants still remains biased to the non-mycorrhizal condition ([^Hartmann_et+al_2009_a]). Many open questions that could guide future research remain: (i) what is the relative importance of the AM fungal influence, i.e. when should mycorrhiza be considered and when is it safe to ignore them; (ii) what is the role of diversity of AM fungi, given that there are tendencies within the phylum Glomeromycota for diverging functions ([^Powell_et+al_2011_a]); (iii) how can the study of AM impact be focused on isolated N-cycling processes given the high interdependence of N-cycling processes; (iv) what is the relative importance of direct AM-induced effects compared to more general AM-mediated plant and microbial community effects on N-cycling processes. We hope to have stimulated soil microbial ecologists and mycorrhizal biologists to tackle some of these important issues.
