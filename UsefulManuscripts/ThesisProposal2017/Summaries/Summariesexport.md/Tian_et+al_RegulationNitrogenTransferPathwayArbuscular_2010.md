## Abstract
The arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) brings together the roots of over 80% of land plant species and fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota and greatly benefits plants through improved uptake of mineral nutrients. AM fungi can take up both nitrate and ammonium from the soil and transfer nitrogen (N) to host roots in nutritionally substantial quantities. ==The current model of N handling in the AM symbiosis includes the synthesis of arginine== in the extraradical mycelium and the transfer of arginine to the intraradical mycelium, where it is broken down to release N for transfer to the host plant. To understand the mechanisms and regulation of N transfer from the fungus to the plant, ==11 fungal genes putatively involved in the pathway were identified from== Glomus intraradices, and for six ==of them the full-length coding sequence was functionally characterized by yeast complementation==. Two glutamine synthetase isoforms were found to have different substrate affinities and expression patterns, suggesting different roles in N assimilation. The spatial and temporal expression of plant and fungal N metabolism genes were followed ==after nitrate was added to the extraradical mycelium under N-limited growth conditions using hairy root cultures==. In parallel experiments with 15N, the levels and labeling of free amino acids were measured to follow transport and metabolism. ==The gene expression pattern and profiling of metabolites involved in the N pathway support the idea that the rapid uptake==, translocation, and transfer of N by the fungus successively trigger metabolic gene expression responses in the extraradical mycelium, intraradical mycelium, and host plant.

## Synopsis

### Introduction
The arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) brings together the roots of over 80% of land plant species and fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota and greatly benefits plants through improved uptake of mineral nutrients.
A mechanism of N transfer from the fungus to the plant has been proposed ([^Bago_et+al_2001_a]) that involves the operation of a novel metabolic route in which N was translocated from the ERM to the intraradical mycelium (IRM) as Arg but transferred to the plant without carbon as inorganic N.
This mechanism has been supported by labeling experiments
The results substantially increase the knowledge of the identity and regulation of most of the metabolic and transport genes involved in N movement through the AM symbiosis

### Methods
Spore Material and Mycorrhizal in Vitro Cultures for 15N Labeling and Gene Expression.
The spore material of Glomus intraradices (DAOM 181602) was purchased from Premier Tech Biotechnologies in units of 106 and was stored at 4°C until further use.
Ri T-DNA-transformed carrot (Daucus carota clone DCI) roots colonized by G. intraradices (DAOM 197198) were grown at 24°C in modified medium ([^Becard_1988_a]) gelled with 3.5 g L21 Phytagel (Sigma) using the split-plate method of [^St-Arnaud_et+al_1996_a]).
The medium of the root compartment was modified to limit the N concentration to 1 mM.
After 2 weeks, the ERM was supplied with 4 mM KNO3 for gene expression studies or K15NO3 to determine the labeling percentage of free amino acids.
The colonized roots and ERM samples were collected after 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 72 h, rinsed with sterilized water, and immediately frozen in liquid N and stored at 280°C until RNA extraction

### Results
Based on data from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA from ERM
Seven full-length and four partial CDSs were obtained that show high sequence similarities to known genes involved in N uptake and metabolism in fungi
The pathway for N metabolism in which these genes have been proposed to operate is shown, which includes the possible regulation of the transcriptional levels of genes by the N metabolites involved in the pathway.
Several full-length CDSs were expressed in yeast, and the antibody directed against the polyhistidine region fused within each Gi sequence was used to detect the expression of the proteins in yeast (Fig. 2A; Supplemental Fig. S11)

### Conclusion
Functional characterization in a heterologous system and/or in vitro was employed because no system for knocking out or otherwise selectively suppressing gene expression has yet been developed in AM fungi
For those enzymes that the authors were unable to characterize by complementation or in vitro, sufficiently long sequences were obtained to test for the presence of conserved functional domains and for the expected phylogenetic relationships to known genes from other organisms.
Those findings are consistent with the putative function of these genes


## Study subjects

### 11 fungal genes
- The current model of N handling in the AM symbiosis includes the synthesis of arginine in the extraradical mycelium and the transfer of arginine to the intraradical mycelium, where it is broken down to release N for transfer to the host plant. ==To understand the mechanisms and regulation of N transfer from the fungus to the plant, 11 fungal genes putatively involved in the pathway were identified from Glomus intraradices, and for six of them the full-length coding sequence was functionally characterized by yeast complementation==. Two glutamine synthetase isoforms were found to have different substrate affinities and expression patterns, suggesting different roles in N assimilation

### 11 genes
- 01 In this study, we postulate that the uptake, translocation, and transfer of N by the fungus triggers the Shawna Rowme etabolic gene expression responses successively in the ERM, IRM, and host plant, which will result in the synthesis and accumulation of Arg in the ERM, the turnover of Arg to release ammonium in the IRM, and the assimilation of ammonium by the host plant via the glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthase (GOGAT) pathway inside the root (Fig. 1). ==To test these predictions, 11 genes involved in the N primary assimilation and metabolism were cloned and verified from Glomus intraradices; six enzymes with full-length coding sequences (CDSs) were functionally characterized by yeast knockout mutant complementation==. Two GS proteins were found to have different substrate affinities and expression patterns, suggesting that they have different roles in N assimilation

### 4 proteins
- The multiple regulation mechanisms for Schizosaccharomyces cerevisiae Arg metabolism has been studied in great detail, such as feedback inhibition, repression of the anabolic pathway, and induction of the catabolic pathway ([^Messenguy_et+al_2000_a]), which indicated the complicated regulation mechanism for Arg metabolism at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels (Werner et al, 1987; Crabeel et al, 1988; Boonchird et al, 1991). ==In S. cerevisiae, the induction of arginase requires the presence of four proteins, ArgRIp (ArgSOp), ArgRIIp (Arg-8lp), ArgRIIIp (ArgRIIIp), and Mcmlp ([^Messenguy_1993_a]), and a CAR1 mutation affecting the expression of the Arg catabolic gene encoding arginase results in the loss of the ability of the cells to use Arg as the N source==. The mutant 12T7cI ura3, DCAR1, and the corresponding wild-type 2T7cI ura3 were used for functional complementation with GiCAR1

## Data analysis
- #method/BLAST

## Findings
- The arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) brings together the roots of over 80% of land plant species and fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota and greatly benefits plants through improved uptake of mineral nutrients
- The host transfers up to 20% of its photosynthetically fixed carbon to the AM fungus (Jakobsen and Rosendahl, 1 This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant nos. 0616016 and 0616023)
- Toussaint et al (2004) showed that in an in vitro mycorrhiza at least 21% of the total N uptake in the roots came from the fungal extraradical mycelium (ERM); for other mycorrhizal systems, even larger proportions have been described (more than 30% and 50%; Govindarajulu et al, 2005; [^Jin_et+al_2005_a])
- The haploid mutant DGLN1 could not grow on the medium without Gln, while it grew well on the plates with 2% Gln
- GiCAR1 was more than 60% identical at the amino acid level to previously described arginases of the ectomycorrhizal fungi Laccaria bicolor and Agaricus bisporus and the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and also showed a region that is highly conserved in the arginase family (SFDVDaldPtvaPStgtpvrgG; Supplemental Fig. S7A)
- As shown in Figure 3D, the yeast strain O2463d Darg81, which lacks OAT activity and is unable to utilize Orn as the sole N source, grew better on minimal medium with only 0.01% Orn and Leu as N sources than the vector control, which showed very limited growth in 2 d at 28°C

## Differs from previous work
- A regulatory scheme is shown in Figure 1 that is based on our observations of the relative timing of N movement and gene expression and is consistent with findings in other fungi, particularly yeast. It is proposed that (1) nitrate availability stimulates the expression of the identified nitrate transporter (most likely together with other high- or low-affinity nitrate transporters), and presumably also of nitrate reductase, although ==we were unable to clone the enzyme sequence reported previously== ([^Kaldorf_et+al_1998_a]; [^Montanini_et+al_2006_a]; [^Rekangalt_et+al_2009_a]); (2) ammonium stimulates the expression of the GS/GOGAT pathway, and increasing levels of Gln and Glu rather than ammonium could lead to an up-regulation of Arg synthesis genes (Hinnebusch, 1988; ter Schure et al, 2000); (3) Arg is then translocated from the ERM to the IRM (Cruz et al, 2007); (4) elevated Arg levels trigger an increase in arginase and urease activities in the IRM but not in the ERM (the difference between IRM and ERM may be due to N catabolite repression in the ERM [Hinnebusch, 1988; Wagemaker et al, 2007], as amino acid levels are substantial in the ERM in the presence of N [^Jin_et+al_2005_a]); (5) Arg or Orn that is produced in the IRM by the action of arginase stimulates the expression and activity of OAT ([^Messenguy_et+al_2000_a]; ter Schure et al, 2000); (6) the subsequent release of ammonium in the IRM could stimulate the passive efflux of ammonia into the mycorrhizal interface and the uptake of ammonium by the plant by specific transporters ([^Selle_et+al_2005_a]; Gomez et al, 2009; Guether et al, 2009); and (7) the subsequent increase in the availability of ammonium for the host causes an up-regulation of plant GS, especially near the sites of N transfer (Chalot et al, 2006)
