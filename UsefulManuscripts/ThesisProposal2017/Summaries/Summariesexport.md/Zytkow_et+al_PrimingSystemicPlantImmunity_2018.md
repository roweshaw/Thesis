## Synopsis
Exhibition of 1851, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and the Royal Academy of Engineering to A.C.; and by a RC-UK Fellowship to L.N.S.
Plants possess inducible systemic defense responses when locally infected by pathogens.
Azelaic acid and AZIl are components of plant systemic immunity involved in priming defenses.
Leaves infected with SAR inducing bacteria produce vascular sap, called petiole exudate, which confers disease resistance to previously unexposed plants [^2], [^3].
The authors hypothesize that any such signal should: (i) show elevated levels in petiole exudates of tissue treated with a SAR-inducing pathogen, (ii) confer local and sys temic disease resistance through a priming event, (iii) be mobile in plants, and (iv) act in a manner that depends on SA.
Furthennore, azelaic acid accumulated in distal systemic tissue as well as petiole exudates when it was locally applied to leaves, showing that it was mobile in plants when labeled with deuterium [HOOC(CD2)7COOH]
To test which genes are necessary for azelaic acid-induced resistance, the authors monitored PmaDG3 growth in leaves of various mutants affecting SAR.

- In four independent experiments, the active exudates con sistently had an average of 6.2-fold higher levels of the dicarboxylic acid azelaic acid (CgH1604) as compared with inactive exudates [5.1 ,M (? 2.3 SEM) in mock-induced exudates versus 31.6 gM (? 10.0 SEM) in active exudates, P= 0.042, ttest]
