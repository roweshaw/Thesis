> The results showed that co-inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia dramatically increased biomass and N content of soybean and maize, and moderate application of N and phosphorus largely amplified the effect of co-inoculation


## Key points
- Intercropping is an essential element of agricultural sustainability, and widely practiced in tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas ([^Maffei_2003_a]; [^Brooker_et+al_2015_a]</a>)
- With co-inoculation, 13C content increased in soybean. These results indicate that photosynthate assimilation is stimulated by AM symbiosis in maize and rhizobial symbiosis in soybean, but arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation leads to soybean investing more carbon than maize into common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs)
- Biomasses of monocropped soybean and maize in the moderate N and P (MNMP) treatment increased by 68–173 and 311–502%, respectively, and those intercropped soybean (IS) and maize biomasses increased by 53–158 and 247–766%, respectively, compared with their biomasses in the corresponding low N (LN) and P (LNLP) cultures (Table 1)
- Moderate application of N and P amplified the effect of AM fungal and rhizobium inoculation, with monoculture and intercropped biomass increases compared to uninoculated controls of 124 and 156%, respectively, for soybean inoculated
- Effective rhizobium inoculation combined with indigenous AM fungi increases N uptake through symbiotic N2 fixation and enhances N transfer by CMNs, which could subsequently contribute to improve intercropping advantages in soybean/maize intercropping system in the field. These results showed that maize has a competitive advantage over soybean in soybean/maize intercropping system
- The results showed that AMF inoculation alone resulted in a net 11.4% 15N transfer, and co-inoculation of AMF and rhizobia led to a 54% increase in amount of 15N transferred from soybean to maize
- The important aspect of this work is the demonstration that the growth advantage of maize is due to increased N acquisition from soybean via CMNs and a relatively low carbon investment into CMNs by maize growing with soybean under conditions favoring symbioses with both rhizobia and AMF

## Synopsis

### Introduction
Intercropping is an essential element of agricultural sustainability, and widely practiced in tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas ([^Maffei_2003_a]; [^Brooker_et+al_2015_a]</a>).
One common intercropping scheme is to pair a cereal crop with a legume that can supply N through biological N2 fixation.
Yield advantages of intercropping legumes with non-N2 fixing crops have been found in many intercropping systems, including ryegrass-subclover ([^Ledgard_et+al_1985_a]), rice-peanut ([^Shen_2004_a]), wheat-faba bean ([^Xiao_et+al_2004_a]), Millet-cowpea ([^Laberge_et+al_2011_a]), rapeseed-faba bean ([^Jamont_et+al_2013_a]), and maize-soybean ([^Tang_et+al_2005_a]</a>; [^Meng_et+al_2015_a]).
It has been reported that intercropping advantages can be explained by above-ground plant–plant interaction effects on light absorption, maintenance of optimal temperatures and space, or below-ground interactions, including root–root interactions, and interactions between roots and beneficial soil microbes ([^Brooker_et+al_2015_a]</a>; [^Li_et+al_2016_a]</a>; Xue et al, 2016).
In the fababean/maize intercropping system, the release of root exudates by fababean promotes acidification of the rhizosphere and enhances P mobilization and acquisition in maize ([^Li_et+al_2007_a]), while root exudates from maize stimulate flavonoid synthesis and nitrogen fixation in fababean ([^Li_et+al_2016_a]</a>)

### Methods
Experimental Materials<br/><br/>The two host plants used were the soybean variety HN89 and the maize variety Tiannuo.
The greenhouse experiment was carried out to check soybean growth performance in response to the varying N and P levels, and rhizobium and AM inoculation treatments, which included four N and P treatments (LN and P, LNLP, 265 μM N and 25 μM P; LN and medium P, LNMP, 265 μM N and 250 μM P; MN and LP, MNLP, 2650 μM N and 25 μM P; MN and P MNMP, 2650 μM N and 250 μM P), two culture modes and three combinations of AM fungal and rhizobium inoculation treatments, including an uninoculated control (−A−R), AM fungal inoculation (+A−R), and inoculation of both the AMF and rhizobium (+A+R).
The growth chamber labeling experiment had one N and P treatment (530 μM N and 50 μM P) with two cropping systems and three combinations of AM fungal and rhizobium inoculation

### Results
The results showed that soybean and maize growth was significantly affected by N and P availability (P < 0.0001; Table 1, Supplementary Table S1).
AM fungal and rhizobium inoculation produced great effects on soybean and maize growth.
Inoculation with rhizobia and/or AMF dramatically increased biomass of soybean and maize (P < 0.0001; Table 1, Supplementary Table S1).
In LNLP, soybean biomass in monoculture and intercropping systems increased by 38 and 52%, respectively, with only AMF inoculation, and by 55 and 66%, respectively, with co-inoculation, while maize biomass increases were 81 and 37%, respectively, with only AMF inoculation, and 81 and 33%, respectively, with coinoculation.
Moderate application of N and P amplified the effect of AM fungal and rhizobium inoculation, with monoculture and intercropped biomass increases compared to uninoculated controls of 124 and 156%, respectively, for soybean inoculated

### Discussion
In legume/cereal intercropping systems, legumes are generally weak competitors compared with cereals ([^Willey_1980_a]; [^Hauggaard-Nielsen_2001_a]), which is often ascribed to differences in the root distributions of legumes and cereals, and the resulting differences in the ability of these crops to compete for soil N ([^Fan_et+al_2006_a]).
In the maize/soybean intercropping system, the yield advantage of maize has been reported ([^Tang_et+al_2005_a]; [^Meng_et+al_2015_a]).
The authors demonstrated that the high competitive ability of maize relative.
MM, monoculture maize; IM, intercropped maize. −A−R: no inoculation; +A−R: sole inoculation with AMF; +A+R: co-inoculation with AMF and rhizobia

### Conclusion
These results showed that maize has a competitive advantage over soybean in soybean/maize intercropping system.
The important aspect of this work is the demonstration that the growth advantage of maize is due to increased N acquisition from soybean via CMNs and a relatively low carbon investment into CMNs by maize growing with soybean under conditions favoring symbioses with both rhizobia and AMF.

## Data analysis
- #method/ANOVA
- #method/three_way_anova
- #method/analysis_of_variance

## Findings
- Results from 15N labeling showed that the amount of N transferred from soybean to maize in co-inoculations was 54% higher than that with AMF inoculation alone, with this increased N transfer partly resulting from symbiotic N fixation
- The results showed that soybean and maize growth was significantly affected by N and P availability (P < 0.0001; Table 1, Supplementary Table S1)
- Inoculation with rhizobia and/or AMF dramatically increased biomass of soybean and maize (P < 0.0001; Table 1, Supplementary Table S1)
- Cropping system had a significant effect on soybean growth (P < 0.0001; Table 1; Supplementary Table S1)
- Under moderate N and low P (MNLP) conditions, IS biomass was 27% less than in monoculture
- Yet, the only effect of intercropping observed for maize was when the biomass of IM was 17% higher than the biomass of monocultured maize in the MNMP and co-inoculation treatment
- Total biomass was obviously higher than those of sole maize and soybean in the MNMP and co-inoculation treatment (P < 0.0001; Figure 1; Supplementary Table S1)
- Moderate N and P application significantly enhanced N and P contents compared to low application rates regardless of inoculation treatment or cropping system (P < 0.0001; Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Table S1)
- Inoculations of soybean and maize with AMF and rhizobia significantly enhanced the contents of N and P in all cropping and nutrient treatments, except for the N and P contents of IM in the co-inoculation treatment reared in the LN treatment (P < 0.0001; Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Table S1)
- The cropping system also significantly affected both N and P contents in soybean and maize (P < 0.0001 for soybean; P < 0.05 for maize; Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Table S1)
- Relative to monocultured maize and soybean, with co-inoculation, there was a 22% increase in the P content of IM in LN and moderate P (LNMP), along with 35 and 42% decreases in N and P contents, respectively, of IS reared in MNLP
- In soybean, AM colonization of monoculture plants in MNMP was 14.8% lower than in MNLP given only AM fungal inoculation
- N and P application also affected soybean nodulation (P < 0.0001; Figure 2A; Supplementary Table S2)
- Nodule numbers also varied significantly among N and P treatments (P < 0.0001; Figure 2B; Supplementary Table S2), with decreases of 88 and 246% observed in MNLP relative to the number of nodules observed on soybean growing in LNLP under monocropping and intercropping conditions, respectively
- Between the two cropping systems, there were no significant differences observed in nodule fresh weight or nodule number, except that the number of nodules on monocropped soybean was 88% higher than on IS growing with MNLP availability (Figure 2B)
- As in the greenhouse experiment, inoculation with AMF and rhizobia significantly increased biomass and N content of soybean and maize irrespective of cropping system (P < 0.0001; Supplementary Figure S3; Supplementary Table S3)
- No significant difference in AM colonization was observed among treatments, except that colonization was lower in monocultured soybean inoculated only with AMF than it was in co-inoculated and IS and maize (Supplementary Figure S4; Supplementary Table S3)
- Biomass and N contents of maize plants were obviously higher when grown together with a neighboring soybean in co-inoculation treatments (P < 0.01; Supplementary Figure S3; Supplementary Table S3)
- Soybean displayed a high N-fixing capacity, with more than 58% of its N being derived from the atmosphere (Table 4)
- Although there was no significant difference in percentage of N transfer (% Ntransfer) between the AM fungal inoculation alone and co-inoculation treatments, the amounts of N transferred from soybean to maize were significantly different, with 1.3 and 2.0 mg plant−1 observed, respectively (Table 4)
- Co-inoculation with AMF and rhizobia enhanced N transfer from soybean to maize, and the percentage N in maize derived from transfer (% NDFT) increased from 11.1% with only AM fungal inoculation to 15.2% with coinoculation (Table 4)
- The results showed that 13C content in monocultured and IS plants increased by 200 and 194% in shoots, and 130 and 113% in roots, respectively, with co-inoculation compared with uninoculated control plants (P < 0.0001; Figure 3; Supplementary Table S3)
- The 13C content in IM shoots increased by 83% with AM fungal inoculation compared with uninoculated maize plants (Figure 3)
- The results showed that AMF inoculation alone resulted in a net 11.4% 15N transfer, and co-inoculation of AMF and rhizobia led to a 54% increase in amount of 15N transferred from soybean to maize (Table 1)

##  Builds on previous research
- In legume/cereal intercropping systems, legumes are generally weak competitors compared with cereals ([^Willey_1980_a]; [^Hauggaard-Nielsen_2001_a]), which is often ascribed to differences in the root distributions of legumes and cereals, and the resulting differences in the ability of these crops to compete for soil N ([^Fan_et+al_2006_a]). ==In the maize/soybean intercropping system, the yield advantage of maize has been also reported== ([^Tang_et+al_2005_a]; [^Meng_et+al_2015_a])

## Differs from previous work
- In the intercropping system, carbon can flow through CMNs ([^Walder_et+al_2012_a]). In ==the present study, IM with AMF alone contained more shoot 13C than uninoculated maize, while soybean displayed the opposite effect== (Figure 3)
- This still needs to be further clarified by quantitative analysis of carbon costs of extracted AMF hyphae in future studies. ==Previous studies have shown that the C3 plant flax acquires more N and P provided by the CMN with little carbon costs, whereas the C4 plant sorghum invests more carbon with little N and P return== ([^Walder_et+al_2012_a])

## Contributions
- These results showed that maize has a competitive advantage over soybean in soybean/maize intercropping system. The important aspect of this work is the demonstration that the growth advantage of maize is due to increased N acquisition from soybean via CMNs and a relatively low carbon investment into CMNs by maize growing with soybean under conditions favoring symbioses with both rhizobia and AMF.<br/><br/>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS<br/><br/>XW and HL conceived the experiments. XW, JS, GW, LS, and DZ designed and performed the experiments. XW, JS and HL drafted the manuscript. XW and HL edited the manuscript. All authors approved the final version.

## Future work
- The loss of biomass in IS relative to monocultures might be attributable to increased N transfer to maize via CMNs in co-inoculation treatments. This still needs to be further clarified by quantitative analysis of carbon costs of extracted AMF hyphae in future studies.
