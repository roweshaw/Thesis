> The four-stage framework acknowledges the multiscale nature of the nonindigenous plant species invasion process and attempts to integrate invasion patterns and the mechanisms underlying these patterns at the different stages


## Key points
- The invasion of nonindigenous plant species (NIPS) is an important component of global environmental change
- Introduced generalist herbivores facilitated NIPS through their negative impact on natives. These results suggest that novel pressure from generalist herbivores may be an important line of defense against NIPS, but, in ecosystems heavily invaded by nonnative herbivores, native plants may suffer from novel herbivore damage
- NIPS spread occurs at the scale of the regional metacommunity: a region containing groups of populations connected through long-distance dispersal ([^Melbourne_et+al_2007_a])
- Theory predicts that increasing heterogeneity in resource availability and site conditions should allow native species and NIPS with different functional traits, competitive abilities and resource optima to coexist at the regional metacommunity scale, resulting in high diversity of both ([^Grime_1974_a]; [^Davies_et+al_2005_a]; [^Smith_2006_a]; [^Melbourne_et+al_2007_a])
- The four-stage framework acknowledges the multiscale nature of the NIPS invasion process and attempts to integrate invasion patterns and the mechanisms underlying these patterns at the different stages
- Increase health and seed recruitment of native plants Promote intact native communities and trophic structure Study the effects of native generalist herbivores on NIPS for potential control Investigate other biocontrols Reduce human disturbances, promote natural disturbance regime Continue cutting, mowing, and herbicide application

## Synopsis

### Introduction
The invasion of nonindigenous plant species (NIPS) is an important component of global environmental change.
Studies may employ different methods or measures of invasion success and there is often no standardized method for evaluating the generality of these conclusions ([^Cadotte_et+al_2006_a])
Recognition of this problem led to field studies and synthesis papers that examined invasion across spatio-temporal scales, often exploring the role of one or two factors in the invasion process
Identifying the stage at which an invasion fails may allow them to understand the interaction of invasion filters with invasion character, species traits, and ecosystem characteristics (Table 2, Fig. 3)
Generalities arising from this type of synthesis can be used to predict the outcome of invasion events, or to.
Integration of processes occurring at different spatial and temporal scales (Figs 2, 3) will allow them to connect local and regional invasion filters with the factors affecting NIPS success (Table 2, Fig. 3).
The invasion process reflects a series of regional, local, and landscape filters that limit NIPS success during four stages of invasion

### Long-distance transport
Transport involves the intercontinental movement of a species into a new region. such species movements have always occurred, current species movements are happening faster than before and from more distant regions, primarily as a result of global commerce and travel ([^Huenneke_1997_a]; Mack et al, 2000; [^Reichard_2001_a]; Le Maitre et al, 2004).
[^Pysek_1998_a]) reports that Eurasia, with 4.4% of the world’s total floral diversity, contributes 58.9% of nonnative species to other regions
This asymmetrical pattern closely parallels historical trends in human colonization, agriculture, horticulture, and trade ([^Delcourt_1987_a]; [^Lonsdale_1999_a]; [^Williamson_1999_a]).
Intercontinental plant transport has occurred accidentally, for utilitarian reasons, and for aesthetic purposes ([^Huenneke_1997_a]</a>; [^Mack_2001_a]</a></a>).
Accidental introductions occurred in ships’ cargo, in seed stock, or with livestock and travelers from other regions ([^Gerlach_1997_a]; [^Mack_2001_a]</a></a>; [^Perrings_et+al_2005_a]).
Invasive species introduced for ornamental purposes in the USA include Cortaderia jubata, Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed) and Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle)

### Colonization
Species that pass through the transport phase do not necessarily colonize their destination area.
NIPS introduced across a wide area of the new region may have a better chance of landing in suitable locations for colonization ([^Lockwood_et+al_2005_a]</a></a></a>) Repeated introductions from the source region may save a population at the brink of extinction ([^Mack_1995_a]</a>), and greater genetic variation may allow NIPS to adapt to novel conditions ([^Sakai_et+al_2001_a]; [^Lavergne_2007_a]).
In California’s nutrient-poor serpentine grassland, [^Huenneke_et+al_1990_a]) found that macronutrient additions increased the overall productivity of the community, decreased species richness, and increased NIPS biomass with or without soil disturbance
Results from this and other studies, as well as theoretical findings, indicate that some NIPS respond more strongly to increased resource availability than native species.
The authors will discuss resource availability and plant invasion further in the context of establishment

### Establishment
A NIPS must colonize a site and develop self-sustaining, expanding populations.
This latter scenario, along with growing recognition of the pace of global biodiversity loss, has given rise to dozens of studies examining the role of plant community diversity in determining invasibility
Studies show that some NIPS have longer life-spans, grow larger, and achieve higher reproduction in invaded ranges than in native ranges ([^Daehler_2003_a]</a>; [^Leger_2003_a]</a>)
These studies have not always found mechanistic explanations linking increased NIPS growth to herbivory ([^Keane_2002_a]</a>).
Interactions between native plants and soil communities tend to be negative, while positive feedbacks often occur between NIPS and soil biota in their introduced range ([^Klironomos_2002_a]).
This species has only recently become an aggressive invader as a result of the evolution of different life-history strategies based on the nature of competition in its new environment ([^Weinig_2000_a]; cited in [^Lee_2002_a]</a>)

### Landscape spread
NIPS spread occurs at the scale of the regional metacommunity: a region containing groups of populations connected through long-distance dispersal ([^Melbourne_et+al_2007_a]</a>).
Variable spread and timing of disturbance events create a mosaic of patches in various stages of succession
This pattern strongly influences the presence and persistence of different species across the landscape ([^Mouquet_et+al_2003_a]).
Alterations of the disturbance regime that increase resource availability or change landscape pattern can promote NIPS spread by creating favorable patches for colonization and establishment
Theory predicts that increasing heterogeneity in resource availability and site conditions should allow native species and NIPS with different functional traits, competitive abilities and resource optima to coexist at the regional metacommunity scale, resulting in high diversity of both ([^Grime_1974_a]; [^Davies_et+al_2005_a]</a>; [^Smith_2006_a]</a></a>; [^Melbourne_et+al_2007_a]).
Invasive NIPS with fast reproduction, short life cycles, and high phenotypic plasticity may respond to change with rapid genetic or phenotypic adaptation ([^Dukes_1999_a]</a></a>; [^Schweitzer_1999_a])

### Findings
[^Pysek_1998_a]) reports that Eurasia, with 4.4% of the world’s total floral diversity, contributes 58.9% of nonnative species to other regions.
As a very approximate rule, [^Williamson_1996_a]) suggest only 10% of imported species give rise to naturalized populations

### Conclusion
The four-stage framework acknowledges the multiscale nature of the NIPS invasion process and attempts to integrate invasion patterns and the mechanisms underlying these patterns at the different stages.
Increase health and seed recruitment of native plants Promote intact native communities and trophic structure Study the effects of native generalist herbivores on NIPS for potential control Investigate other biocontrols Reduce human disturbances, promote natural disturbance regime Continue cutting, mowing, and herbicide application.
Minimize disturbance corridors through natural landscapes Promote native species that can compete with NIPS at the edges of disturbance corridors Isolate source populations of NIPS Eliminate or reduce transport vectors in natural areas during reproductive stage of NIPS growth Prioritize use of local techniques to manage colonization and establishment n sites that are most susceptible to invasion.
The authors recommend that management approaches explicitly consider the targeted stage, and enhance natural filters in order to prevent invasion success (Table 4).
It is likely that managing multiple stages of the invasion process simultaneously will be most effective


## Study subjects

### 63 studies
- For instance, intense grazing by introduced ungulates can increase the invasibility of native plant communities (D’Antonio et al, 2000). ==In a metaanalysis of 63 studies, [^Parker_et+al_2006_a]) found that native generalist herbivores suppressed introduced plants more than they suppressed natives, while native specialist herbivores did not suppress NIPS==. Introduced generalist herbivores facilitated NIPS through their negative impact on natives

### 6 studies
- [^Reinhart_2006_a]) recently reviewed available biogeographical comparison studies investigating the effect of soil biota on NIPS in native and nonnative ranges. ==In all six studies the direction of soil–plant feedback was strongly negative in the native ranges of the NIPS==. In the introduced ranges, feedback was strongly negative in only one case

### 14 studies
- However, studies conducted at landscape scales often reveal correlations between the distance to disturbance corridors and NIPS presence or abundance ([^Timmens_1991_a]; D’Antonio et al, 2000; [^Parendes_2000_a]; [^Rubino_et+al_2002_a]</a>; [^Gelbard_2003_a]; [^Watkins_et+al_2003_a]; [^Searcy_et+al_2006_a]). ==D’Antonio et al (2000) reviewed 14 studies of disturbance corridors and found that half reported NIPS movement into adjacent undisturbed habitat, while the other half found that NIPS remained only in corridors==. NIPS spread from corridors into adjacent natural systems likely depends on the nature of the ecosystem, the traits of the invader and the time since invasion (D’Antonio et al, 2000; [^Rubino_et+al_2002_a]</a>)

## Findings
- [^Pysek_1998_a]) reports that Eurasia, with 4.4% of the world’s total floral diversity, contributes 58.9% of nonnative species to other regions
- As a very approximate rule, [^Williamson_1996_a]) suggest only 10% of imported species give rise to naturalized populations

##  Builds on previous research
- Invasive NIPS can act synergistically with other elements of global change, including land-use change ([^Vitousek_et+al_1996_a]</a>; [^Hobbs_2000_a]), climate change ([^Dukes_1999_a]</a>; [^Simberloff_2000_a]; [^Kriticos_et+al_2003_a]), increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen deposition ([^Dukes_1999_a]</a>; [^Dukes_2002_a]; [^Weltzin_et+al_2003_a]). ==Studies of traits that make NIPS invasive ([^Baker_1965_a]; [^Rejmanek_1996_b]), characteristics of invasible communities ([^Elton_1958_a]; [^Lonsdale_1999_a]; [^Davis_et+al_2000_a]), and ecosystem or community responses to invasion ([^Levine_et+al_2003_a]; D’Antonio & Hobbie, 2005) have increased our understanding of the invasion process==
- These papers suggest that the failure to identify a general suite of factors underlying invasion success may have resulted from attempts to extract generalities from diverse studies that do not address invasion at the same spatio-temporal stage (e.g. [^Kolar_2001_a]</a>). ==In this review==, we examine the broad categorical filters that NIPS pass through at four well-established (e.g. [^Vermeij_1996_a]) spatio-temporal stages of invasion: transport, colonization, establishment, and landscape spread (Figs 1, 2)

## Differs from previous work
- Taken together, results of these neighborhood-scale diversity– invasibility studies suggest that diverse plant communities often (but not always) provide greater competitive resistance to NIPS ([^Hooper_et+al_2005_a]</a>). So, does resistance result from niche complementarity or reduced resource overlap (i.e. many species with ==different resource requirements collectively reducing the perceived availability of resources for the invader)? Or are diverse communities resistant to invasion simply because they are more likely to include the species that most strongly compete with a suite of NIPS (i.e. the much-discussed ‘sampling effect’ of the biodiversity literature) ([^Hooper_et+al_2005_a]</a>)? While many early studies were unable to address this question== ([^Wardle_2001_a]), it now seems that the answer may be: both

While many early studies were unable to address this question ([^Wardle_2001_a]), it now seems that the answer may be: both. ==Recent studies suggest three nonexclusive patterns of competition. (1) In some systems, growth of invasive species can be suppressed by species that are morphologically, phenologically, and physiologically similar==, that is, species of the same functional type (e.g. [^Dukes_2001_a]</a>; [^Fargione_et+al_2003_a]</a>; van Ruijven et al, 2003). (2) In other cases (and even in some of the same systems), a single dominant species or functional group can most strongly suppress all or most invaders ([^Symstad_2000_a]; [^Fargione_et+al_2003_a]</a>). (3) Finally, in some systems, an assemblage of species with different traits can compete more strongly with an invader than any one species alone ([^Fargione_2005_a]; [^Milbau_et+al_2005_a]; [^Losure_et+al_2007_a])

## Contributions
- The four-stage framework acknowledges the multiscale nature of the NIPS invasion process and attempts to integrate invasion patterns and the mechanisms underlying these patterns at the different stages. Future studies that approach at least two different stages of invasion (e.g. [^Levine_2000_a]; [^Davies_et+al_2005_a]; [^Knight_2005_a]) can provide excellent insights into invasions. Where possible, we recommend<br/><br/>Management strategies<br/><br/>Regulate nursery trade more strictly Promote native species in landscape design Screen seed stock more effectively Educate the public about the consequences of NIPS and how to prevent their introduction (not buying nonnative ornamentals, not planting house plants outdoors, etc.)<br/><br/>Use climate envelope techniques to predict range of potential NIPS Reduce habitat fragmentation and edge effects Start cutting, mowing, and herbicide treatments immediately    Establishment<br/><br/>Increase health and seed recruitment of native plants Promote intact native communities and trophic structure Study the effects of native generalist herbivores on NIPS for potential control (make sure these species do not prefer natives) Investigate other (native) biocontrols Reduce human disturbances, promote natural disturbance regime Continue cutting, mowing, and herbicide application<br/><br/>Minimize disturbance corridors through natural landscapes Promote native species that can compete with NIPS at the edges of disturbance corridors (e.g. early successional natives) Isolate source populations of NIPS Eliminate or reduce transport vectors (such as deer) in natural areas during reproductive stage of NIPS growth Prioritize use of local techniques to manage colonization and establishment n sites that are most susceptible to invasion (e.g. sites with high numbers of reproducing individuals, and adjacent sites, sites on the edge of landscapes).<br/><br/>adopting this approach. We also recommend that management approaches explicitly consider the targeted stage, and enhance natural filters in order to prevent invasion success (Table 4). It is likely that managing multiple stages of the invasion process simultaneously will be most effective.

## Future work
- Future studies that approach at least two different stages of invasion (e.g. [^Levine_2000_a]; [^Davies_et+al_2005_a]; [^Knight_2005_a]) can provide excellent insights into invasions. Where possible, we recommend.
