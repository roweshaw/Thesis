## Abstract
A doubling in global food demand projected for the next 50 years poses huge challenges for the sustainability both of food production and of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and ==the services they provide to society==. ==Agriculturalists are the principal managers of global useable lands== and will shape, perhaps irreversibly, the surface of the Earth in the coming decades. New incentives and policies for ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and ecosystem services will be ==crucial if we are to meet the demands of improving yields without compromising environmental integrity== or public health.

## Key points
- The benefits of agriculture have been immense
- Global cereal production has doubled in the past 40 years (Fig. 1a), mainly from the increased yields resulting from greater inputs of fertilizer, water and pesticides, new crop strains, and other technologies of the ‘Green Revolution’[^2],[^3],[^4]
- We focus here on scientific and policy challenges that must be met to sustain and increase the net societal benefits of intensive agricultural production
- Agricultural practices determine the level of food production and, to a great extent, the state of the global environment
- If society is to maximize the net benefits of agriculture, there must be a fuller accounting of both the costs and the benefits of alternative agricultural practices, and such an accounting must become the basis of policy, ethics and action
- Pesticides can harm human health, as can pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant pathogens associated with certain animal production practices. How can such costs be minimized at the same time that food production is increased? In one sense the answer is simple: crop and livestock production must increase without an increase in the negative environmental impacts associated with agriculture, which means large increases in the efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus and water use, and integrated pest management that minimizes the need for toxic pesticides

## Synopsis

### Agricultural sustainability and intensive production practices
Global cereal production has doubled in the past 40 years (Fig. 1a), mainly from the increased yields resulting from greater inputs of fertilizer, water and pesticides, new crop strains, and other technologies of the ‘Green Revolution’[^2],[^3],[^4].
This has increased the global per capita food supply[^2], reducing hunger, improving nutrition and sparing natural ecosystems from conversion to agriculture[^5].
The authors focus here on scientific and policy challenges that must be met to sustain and increase the net societal benefits of intensive agricultural production

### Sustainability and net benefits
Agricultural practices determine the level of food production and, to a great extent, the state of the global environment.
In one sense the answer is simple: crop and livestock production must increase without an increase in the negative environmental impacts associated with agriculture, which means large increases in the efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus and water use, and integrated pest management that minimizes the need for toxic pesticides.
In reality, achieving such a scenario represents one of the greatest scientific challenges facing humankind because of the trade-offs among competing economic and environmental goals, and inadequate knowledge of the key biological, biogeochemical and ecological processes.

### Findings
Nitrogen-fertilizer efficiency of maize in the United States has increased by 36% in the past 21 years as a result of large investments in public sector research and extension education, and investments by farmers in soil testing and improved timing of fertilizer application[^40],[^52].
The global rate of increase in irrigated area is declining, per capita irrigated area has declined by 5% since 1978, and new dam construction may allow only a 10% increase in water for irrigation over the 30 years[^60],[^61].
During the past 40 years, global per capita meat production has increased more than 60% (Fig. 3), a trend driven by increasing global per capita incomes, but threatened by stagnant or declining per capita grain production (Fig. 3)

### Pesticide imports
Farmland is already used for agriculture, which means that further area expansion would occur on marginal land that is unlikely to sustain high yields and is vulnerable to degradation[^6],[^31].
Rice paddy agriculture and livestock production are the most important anthropogenic sources of the greenhouse gas methane[^51]
Solutions to these problems will require significant increases in nutrient-use efficiency, that is, in cereal production per unit of added nitrogen, phosphorus and water.
Increasing water-use efficiency Forty per cent of crop production comes from the 16% of agricultural land that is irrigated[^59],[^60].
The goal of sustainable agriculture is to maximize the net benefits that society receives from agricultural production of food and fibre and from ecosystem services
This will require increased crop yields, increased efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus and water use, ecologically based management practices, judicious use of pesticides and antibiotics, and major changes in some livestock production practices.

## Findings
- Nitrogen-fertilizer efficiency of maize in the United States has increased by 36% in the past 21 years as a result of large investments in public sector research and extension education, and investments by farmers in soil testing and improved timing of fertilizer application[^40],[^52]
- The global rate of increase in irrigated area is declining, per capita irrigated area has declined by 5% since 1978, and new dam construction may allow only a 10% increase in water for irrigation over the next 30 years[^60],[^61]
- During the past 40 years, global per capita meat production has increased more than 60% (Fig. 3), a trend driven by increasing global per capita incomes, but threatened by stagnant or declining per capita grain production (Fig. 3)

## Differs from previous work
- Doubling food production again, and sustaining food production at this level, are major challenges[^8],[^9],[^10],[^11]. ==Doing so in ways that do not compromise environmental integrity==[^4],[^12],[^13] and public health[^14],[^15] is a greater challenge still
