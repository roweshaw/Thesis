## Abstract
PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Multiple mutualist effects (MMEs) are common in nature, yet we lack a predictive understanding of how two mutualists on the same host will influence each other and whether these effects will be positive or negative. Leguminous plants maintain root symbioses with two nutritional mutualists: rhizobia that fix atmospheric nitrogen and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that increase phosphorus uptake. Both symbionts receive plant carbon, and host genetic networks that regulate colonization are partially shared by both symbioses; whether these factors generate trade-offs or facilitation between rhizobial and AMF symbionts of legumes is not well known. ==METHODS: We evaluated host allocation to each symbiont in three settings==. First, in situ in a remnant prairie, then in a greenhouse experiment with multiple plant populations, and finally under manipulated rhizobium densities in the greenhouse. KEY RESULTS: In the remnant prairie, rhizobium nodule number and colonization of AMF were positively correlated, and plants with increased nodule number had higher fitness in the field, generating indirect selection on the colonization of AMF. In the greenhouse experiment, allocation to each symbiont was genetically variable among populations, with some suggestion that rhizobium and AMF colonization are positively genetically correlated. Finally, increasing the number of rhizobia in the soil decreased AMF colonization. ==CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that trade-offs between plant colonization by rhizobia and AMF are context dependent and might not be common under field conditions, but that physiological and/or genetic drivers couple these two symbioses in nature==.

## Key points
- Pairwise mutualisms do not occur in isolation within their natural ecosystems; rather, mutualist species are embedded in networks of multiple mutualistic interactions
- Correlations between rhizobium and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization in the field—We found significant positive phenotypic correlations between several variables in the field
- Significant positive correlations between total nodule number and AMF colonization were still significant after controlling for the size of the root system by including root biomass as a covariate, indicating that plant vigor alone is unlikely to explain these relationships
- We found significant positive selection coefficients (S) for many variables in the field, root biomass, nodule number, mean nodule biomass, and the density of AMF arbuscules and hyphae, but notably not spores (Table 2)
- Variation in rhizobium and AMF colonization in the greenhouse— Population was a significant source of variation for all symbiotic traits of interest, in particular nodule number and AMF colonization, indicating that C. fasciculata possesses genetic variation for allocation to AMF and rhizobium symbiotic structures at the population and/or individual level
- We found a 96% difference in AMF colonization between the most- and least-colonized populations along with a 85% difference in total nodule number between mostand least-nodulated populations (15 and 31, respectively)

## Synopsis

### Introduction
Pairwise mutualisms do not occur in isolation within their natural ecosystems; rather, mutualist species are embedded in networks of multiple mutualistic interactions.
If the presence of one symbiont increases resource availability in a way that releases the host from limitation or otherwise promotes allocation to a second symbiont, the authors would expect to observe positive correlations between the colonization of multiple symbiotic species ([^Afkhami_et+al_2014_a]</a>)
Both ant and scale mutualists of tropical Macaranga trees draw on host phloem, the abundance of ants increases with the abundance of coccoid scales, possibly because increased abundance of honeydew produced by the scales facilitates more effective ant defense ([^Pringle_et+al_2011_a]).
Legumes interact with AMF, which colonize plant roots and develop multiple intraradical structures, increasing plant nutrient and mineral acquisition ( phosphorus ([^Smith_2008_a]))
Both rhizobium and AMF symbionts use the host’s photosynthetically fixed carbon, which might play a role in the level of symbiont colonization each plant can maintain ([^Harris_et+al_1985_a]</a>).
Whether these effects hold up in the field and generate trade-offs or facilitation between rhizobia and AMF in nature is not known

### Methods
Study system—Partridge pea [Chamaecrista fasciculata, (Michx.) Greene] is a self-compatible, outcrossing annual legume, commonly found in prairies, bluffs, sandy savannahs, and alongside river banks ([^Foote_1966_a]; [^Fenster_1991_a]).
Like many legumes, it regularly associates with rhizobia (likely Bradyrhizobium species, forming indeterminate nodules; ([^Parker_2006_a]), as well as AMF ([^Smith_2008_a]).
Field observations—To understand the relationships among plant performance and measures of symbiont colonization in natural populations, the authors collected data on plant size, nodulation, and AMF colonization from 178 plant individuals sampled in situ from a remnant savannah population near the Mskoda Preserve in Kankakee County, Illinois, United States (41°04.762′N, 87°39.419′W).

### Results
Correlations between rhizobium and AMF colonization in the field—The authors found significant positive phenotypic correlations between several variables in the field.
Larger plants had more and heavier nodules and were more densely colonized by AMF hyphae and arbuscules (Table 1).
Significant positive correlations between total nodule number and AMF colonization were still significant after controlling for the size of the root system by including root biomass as a covariate, indicating that plant vigor alone is unlikely to explain these relationships.
The authors found significant positive selection coefficients (S) for many variables in the field, root biomass, nodule number, mean nodule biomass, and the density of AMF arbuscules and hyphae, but notably not spores (Table 2).
The authors found a 96% difference in AMF colonization between the most- and least-colonized populations along with a 85% difference in total nodule number between mostand least-nodulated populations (15 and 31, respectively)

### Discussion
Rhizobium and AMF symbioses provide complementary nutrients to plant hosts, and legume signaling pathways that control the initiation, maintenance, and number of infections are known to be shared by both symbioses.
On how such known nutritional and regulatory overlap might impact a host’s ability to maintain multiple symbioses or whether these shared genes have implications for ecological or evolutionary responses in contemporary natural populations.
The authors studied rhizobium and AMF colonization of partridge pea in the field and greenhouse to explore whether plants experience tradeoffs as a result of having multiple carbon-requiring mutualistic partners, how rhizobium abundances influence AMF colonization, and the potential for evolutionary response(s) in host colonization by these symbionts.
The results of the phenotypic selection analysis in the field are consistent with the action of selective agents that favor increased AMF colonization in nature, but only as a result of direct selection on separate targets of selection.
The authors' study suggests that rhizobium nodulation and AMF colonization, and the success of these symbionts, are linked via their plant hosts, and in ways not predictable if studied pairwise

### Conclusion
To understand the ecological implications and evolutionary outcomes of mutualisms, is it necessary to go beyond pairwise relationships and instead incorporate the effects of multiple symbionts on a single host ([^Benkman_et+al_2001_a]; [^Palmer_et+al_2010_a]; [^Larimer_et+al_2014_a]).
The authors have studied symbiotic traits in a multiplayer mutualism and found that, despite known coregulatory mechanisms and previous work suggesting trade-offs between rhizobium and AMF colonization under some conditions, these legume hosts are not likely to experience trade-offs between rhizobial and AMF symbionts in natural populations.
The authors' work suggests that whether MMEs between these symbionts are positive or negative will be context dependent, varying with the experimental conditions that influence colonization rates, namely, symbiont abundances or soil nutrients.
Further work will be necessary to partition the effects of genetic vs environmental variation and clarify whether the coupling of rhizobial and AMF infection rates results from shared negative feedback systems in the host and/or plastic responses to the biotic or abiotic environment


## Study subjects

### 178 plant individuals
- A preliminary survey of fungal diversity from soil collected from the remnant prairie used in our experiments identified Rhizophagus intaradices, Acaulospora morrowiae, A. spinosa, A. scrobiculata, A. paulinae, Paraglomus occultum, and Funneliformis mosseae (J. ==Morton, International Culture Collection of Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi or INVAM, personal communication).<br/><br/>1334 • AMERICANJOURNALOFB OTA N Y<br/><br/>Field observations—To understand the relationships among plant performance and measures of symbiont colonization in natural populations, we collected data on plant size, nodulation, and AMF colonization from 178 plant individuals sampled in situ from a remnant savannah population near the Mskoda Preserve in Kankakee County, Illinois, United States (41°04.762′N, 87°39.419′W)==. In each of two patches, individuals of C. fasciculata were collected as they occurred along two 20-m transects, which spanned the length of a sunny open patch where the species was abundant

### 100 data
- Because rhizobium and AMF density are best estimated while plants are actively growing rather than senescent, we were unable to measure seed set. ==In a separate survey of 100 plants from the same population in the following year, aboveground biomass was highly predictive of seed number (N = 100, R = 0.7478, P < 0.0001).Study system—Partridge pea [Chamaecrista fasciculata, (Michx.)

## Findings
- In a separate survey of 100 plants from the same population in the following year, aboveground biomass was highly predictive of seed number (N = 100, R = 0.7478, P < 0.0001)
- To ensure that our random subsample of 10 feeder root segments provided an accurate estimate of AMF colonization, we examined all segments from 10 experimental plants and correlated the total number of arbuscules and (as well as the proportion of fragments for spores and hyphae) on the entire root system with our estimates from randomly subsampling 10 cm of feeder root length (R ranged from 0.78 to 0.97; all P < 0.005; see Appendix S1 in Supplemental Data with the online version of this article)
- Significant positive correlations between total nodule number and AMF colonization were still significant after controlling for the size of the root system by including root biomass as a covariate (arbuscule density P < 0.01 and hyphal density P < 0.02), indicating that plant vigor alone is unlikely to explain these relationships
- Consistent with field observations, we found significant positive phenotypic correlations between rhizobial and AMF colonization that persisted after accounting for plant biomass (arbuscule density, P < 0.0009, hyphal density P < 0.0001)—once again suggesting that these relationships are not merely a function of plant vigor (Table 1)
- We found a significant, positive relationship between the means for nodule number and arbuscule density (N = 28, r = 0.567, P = 0.0315), though this relationship was no longer significant when two populations (3 and 22) that allowed particularly dense colonization of symbionts were excluded from the analysis (results not shown)
- The effect of rhizobium inoculation on nodule number itself was not significant, though the means were in the expected direction, with nodule number increasing by 28% (see Appendix S6)
- The one exception was the arbuscule to nodule ratio, which differed among the three populations tested (Table 3); this interaction was driven by plants growing in soil from the Mskoda Sands population, the only population in which inoculation significantly decreased the arbuscule to nodule ratio (from 11.0 ± 2.4 to 0.7 ± 2.4, P = 0.0312 based on Tukey’s honestly significant difference [HSD] test)
- We found that, although arbuscule density was positively correlated with nodule number overall (linear term = 0.8622; t1588 = 3.38; P = 0.0008), a significant and negative quadratic term indicated that the slope of this relationship decreases at larger nodule numbers (quadratic slope = –0.0072; t1588 = −3.76, P = 0.0002)
- [^Larimer_et+al_2014_a]) also found that fertilization mediated the effects of AMF on nodulation; the prairie legume Amorpha canescens made more nodules in the presence of AMF across all nutrient environments, but the effect was actually much larger when plants were fertilized with N or P (~200% increase with fertilization, vs. ~60% increase without fertilization; A

##  Builds on previous research
- On one hand, the costs of maintaining symbionts could generate trade-offs among host investment in various symbioses. ==For example, in plants that associate with nutrient-acquiring mycorrhizal fungi and protective fungal endophytes, the presence and/or increased establishment of endophytes has been observed to reduce colonization of host roots by mycorrhizal fungi== ([^Guo_et+al_1992_a]; [^Omacini_et+al_2006_a]; [^Mack_2008_a])
- Consistent with field observations, we found significant positive phenotypic correlations between rhizobial and AMF colonization that persisted after accounting for plant biomass (arbuscule density, P < 0.0009, hyphal density P < 0.0001)—once again suggesting that these relationships are not merely a function of plant vigor (Table 1). ==These results, in combination with the patterns of indirect selection observed in the field== (Table 2 and discussed already), suggest the potential for genetic covariance between plant colonization by rhizobia and AMF to constrain or facilitate the response of these traits to selection ([^Waitt_1998_a])
- While phenotypic correlations based on field observations represent the integrated outcome of natural processes and thus provide ecological relevance, they are only a starting point because they result from the sum of environmental and genetic (co) variance in the traits of interest. Given previous functional work on legume–rhizobium–AMF tripartite interactions ([^Catford_et+al_2003_a]; [^Gherbi_et+al_2008_a]), the positive covariance ==we observed is likely to stem from== (1) environmental covariance due to spatial variation in myriad potential abiotic or biotic factors, (2) shared host genetic pathways that regulate both symbioses (i.e., genetic covariance), or (3) both
- Such genetic covariance could potentially couple the evolutionary responses of hosts to multiple symbionts ([^Wise_2013_a]), and knowing a priori from functional genetic studies that these networks are shared within hosts gives weight to this possibility ([^Oldroyd_2013_a]</a>; [^Catford_et+al_2003_a]</a>). ==The evolutionary implications of any shared regulatory pathways depend on the degree to which genetic variation in the traits under selection (here==, rhizobium and AMF colonization density) exist in the shared vs. independent genes of these known pathways and, of course, patterns of selection in nature ([^Lynch_1998_a]; [^Conner_2004_a])

## Differs from previous work
- AMF develop several other recognizable and quantifiable structures within the fine “feeder” roots of their host plants, including intraradical hyphae and spores ([^Hayman_1983_a]; [^Klironomos_et+al_1993_a]; [^Klironomos_2003_a]; Karandashov et al, 2004; [^Smith_et+al_2004_a]), which we also quantified. ==We did not examine the extent of extraradical hyphae or spores==, which might represent a significant sink for plantderived carbon ([^Jakobsen_1990_a])
- We do note that we did not estimate the extent of extraradical hyphae in our studies, so we would be unable to detect any trade-offs imposed by AMF allocation to these structures. Host negative feedback systems that regulate symbiont densities have been presumed to be an adaptation to prevent over-colonization and thus wasted photosynthate (e.g., [^Caetano-Anolles_1991_a]); to ==our knowledge, this notion has not been tested==
- Because N and P alter the cost–benefit ratio of symbiosis for plant hosts ([^Bronstein_1994_a]; [^West_et+al_2002_a]), it stands to reason that MMEs resulting from legume–rhizobium–AMF interactions will depend on the soil nutrient environment. ==We cannot know with certainty why nodulation was so dense in the inoculation experiment because we did not enumerate the rhizobium populations in these natural soils==
- Larimer, Indiana University, personal communication). Despite the likelihood that P is a key variable differentiating the inoculation experiment from the field and greenhouse studies, it is possible that other environmental variables (e.g., other nutrients, light availability, or even priority effects such as rhizobium saturation prior to AMF colonization; [^Werner_2015_a]) could partially or entirely explain the variation ==we observed in the direction of MMEs among these experiments==
- It is difficult to know which, if any, of the many unmeasured variables might contribute to our phenotypic correlations; nevertheless, this issue could be eliminated in future studies by estimating selection using breeding values from quantitative genetic designs transplanted into the field (e.g., [^Etterson_2001_a]). ==Yet, given the results from our greenhouse and inoculation experiments== (where microenvironmental variation is randomized with respect to genotype and treatment), as well as previous studies demonstrating that these symbionts influence each other under controlled conditions (e.g., [^Kaschuk_et+al_2009_a], [^Kaschuk_et+al_2010_a]; [^Lekberg_2005_a]</a></a>), it seems likely that coupled rhizobium and AMF responses to one or more environmental factors are at least partly responsible for the positive phenotypic correlations we found in the field

## Contributions
- To understand the ecological implications and evolutionary outcomes of mutualisms, is it necessary to go beyond pairwise relationships and instead incorporate the effects of multiple symbionts on a single host ([^Benkman_et+al_2001_a]; [^Palmer_et+al_2010_a]; [^Larimer_et+al_2014_a]). Moreover, we must also move beyond studying fitness effects per se and identify specific fitness-related traits that are impacted by these multiplayer interactions (Strauss et al, 2004; [^Afkhami_et+al_2014_a]). Here we have studied symbiotic traits in a multiplayer mutualism and found that, despite known coregulatory mechanisms and previous work suggesting trade-offs between rhizobium and AMF colonization under some conditions, these legume hosts are not likely to experience trade-offs between rhizobial and AMF symbionts in natural populations. Nevertheless, our work also suggests that whether MMEs between these symbionts are positive or negative will be context dependent, varying with the experimental conditions that influence colonization rates, namely, symbiont abundances or soil nutrients. Further work will be necessary to partition the effects of genetic vs. environmental variation and thus clarify whether the coupling of rhizobial and AMF infection rates results from shared negative feedback systems in the host and/or plastic responses to the biotic or abiotic environment.

## Future work
- Further work manipulating symbiont abundances, nutrient levels, and/or host and symbiont genotypes in factorial combinations will help us reach a general understanding of MMEs in this system, as well as their environmental-dependence, and the potential ecological implications of tripartite interactions between legumes, rhizobia, and AMF.
- It is difficult to know which, if any, of the many unmeasured variables might contribute to our phenotypic correlations; this issue could be eliminated in future studies by estimating selection using breeding values from quantitative genetic designs transplanted into the field (e.g., [^Etterson_2001_a]).
- Our evidence implying natural selection on symbiont colonization in the field, together with the potential for positive genetic covariance between nodulation and AMF colonization from the greenhouse experiment, suggest that shared genetic mechanisms have the potential to link the evolution of these interactions in nature. Connecting genetic architecture with MMEs will be an interesting avenue for future work.
- Further work will be necessary to partition the effects of genetic vs. environmental variation and clarify whether the coupling of rhizobial and AMF infection rates results from shared negative feedback systems in the host and/or plastic responses to the biotic or abiotic environment.
