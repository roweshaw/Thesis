## Abstract
Nutrient limitation to primary productivity and other biological processes is widespread in terrestrial ecosystems, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most common limiting elements, both individually and in combination. Mechanisms that drive P limitation, and their interactions with the N cycle, have received less attention than mechanisms causing N limitation. ==We identify and discuss six mechanisms that could drive P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems==. The best known of these is depletion-driven limitation, in which accumulated P losses during long-term soil and ecosystem development contribute to what Walker and Syers termed a ‘‘terminal steady state’’ of profound P depletion and limitation. The other mechanisms are soil barriers that prevent access to P; transactional limitation, in which weathering of P-containing minerals does not keep pace with the supply of other resources; low-P parent materials; P sinks; and anthropogenic changes that increase the supply of other resources (often N) relative to P. We distinguish proximate nutrient limitation (which occurs where additions of a nutrient stimulate biological processes, especially productivity) from ultimate nutrient limitation (where additions of a nutrient can transform ecosystems). ==Of the mechanisms that drive P limitation, we suggest that depletion, soil barriers, and low-P parent material often cause ultimate limitation because they control the ecosystem mass balance of P==. Similarly, demand-independent losses and constraints to N fixation can control the ecosystem-level mass balance of N and cause it to be an ultimate limiting nutrient.

## Synopsis

### PERSPECTIVES ON THE MODERN N CYCLE
Ecological Applications, 20(1), 2010, pp. 5–15 Ó 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.

### INTRODUCTION
The importance of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) limitation to primary production and other ecosystem processes has been demonstrated in a wide variety of terrestrial ecosystems.
3. In contrast, combined N is nearly absent from most igneous and metamorphic rocks; outside of ecosystems underlain by certain sedimentary and meta-sedimentary rocks ([^Dahlgren_1994_a], [^Holloway_2002_a]), most terrestrial ecosystems are largely devoid of N as they begin their development ([^Walker_1976_a]).
Biological processes in many ecosystems on young soils may be limited by low supplies of N.
This temporal pattern in P vs N limitation gives rise to a geographical one ([^Vitousek_1986_a]), because over the last several million years high-latitude systems have been systematically and cyclically influenced by glaciation and related processes that rejuvenate their supply of P and other

### INVITED FEATURE
Ecological Applications Vol 20, No 1 rock-derived nutrients and can remove their stocks of N.
Mean responses to N plus P additions were even greater
They found little evidence for latitudinal or growth-form differences in the mean responsiveness of plant growth to N vs P, the few tropical forest experiments they summarized reported more limitation by P than by N.
[^Elser_et+al_2007_a]) concluded that many ecosystems are poised near the point where N and P are limiting to the growth of plants
They suggested that the identity of limiting nutrients in terrestrial environments should not be assumed, and that both science and management should recognize that ongoing human-caused alterations in the cycles of either N or P ([^Vitousek_et+al_1997_a], [^Bennett_et+al_2001_a], [^Galloway_et+al_2008_a]), and of both together, have the potential to alter the dynamics of many ecosystems.
Here the authors focus on the mechanisms that could cause or contribute to P limitation, and explore how the mechanisms driving P limitation relate to and interact with those driving N limitation

### NUTRIENT LIMITATION CONCEPTS
Before addressing the mechanisms underlying P limitation in particular, the authors discuss a conceptual framework for nutrient limitation in general.
Additions of N can allow organisms to produce more extracellular phosphatase enzymes that cleave ester-P bonds in soil organic matter ([^Mcgill_1981_a], [^Olander_2000_a], [^Treseder_2001_a], [^Wang_et+al_2007_a]), increasing local availability of P
These interactions are not fully symmetrical; by affecting N fixation, P supply affects the quantity of N within ecosystems, while additional phosphatase enzymes affect the rate of cycling but not the quantity of P within ecosystems.
Species that have evolved toward different resource requirements may simultaneously be limited by and respond to different resources in a common environment, a situation that in the aggregate represents MRL ([^Gleeson_1992_a])
Another challenge in applying the concepts underlying nutrient limitation is the distinction between proximate and ultimate limiting resources.
A combination of sustained whole-system experiments like those summarized by [^Schindler_1977_a], [^Schindler_et+al_2008_a]), long-term observational studies, and fundamental understanding of the biogeochemical mechanisms that drive nutrient limitation can allow ultimate limiting nutrients to be identified and characterized

### MECHANISMS UNDERLYING PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION
The authors recognize six mechanisms that can cause P limitation to terrestrial ecosystems: P depletion, soil barriers, transactional, low-P parent materials, P sinks, and anthropogenic forcings (Table 1).
Sites reach soil ages of 40 000 years, much less 4 million years, without having their parent material P rejuvenated or subsidized by glacial or periglacial processes
Consistent with this suggested geographical pattern, P limitation plays a more prominent role in tropical than in temperate agriculture ([^Sanchez_1976_a]), and a substantial subset of lowland tropical forests have lower tissue P concentrations and much wider N:P ratios than do any temperate forests ([^Vitousek_1984_a], [^Mcgroddy_et+al_2004_a]).
In contrast to tropical areas, Pleistocene glaciations have ensured that few cold-temperate or high-latitude

### Phosphorus limitation caused by the development of soil barriers
Cally separating biota from P and P-bearing minerals
The authors term this class of mechanisms soil barrier-driven P limitation.
Iron pans that form in high-rainfall regions can constrain root access to deeper parts of soil profiles and restrict drainage, routing water horizontally rather than vertically through soils and in high-rainfall sites causing soil saturation and anaerobiosis ([^Mckeague_et+al_1983_a], [^Kitayama_et+al_1997_a]).
Acidic, highaluminum subsoils that form in many high-rainfall environments may permit water flow but serve as a barrier to the growth of roots towards deeper, more Prich portions of soil profiles ([^Soethe_et+al_2006_a]).
By blocking root access to deeper soil horizons with P-containing minerals, barriers can have a greater effect on the supply of P than N, making limitation by P more likely.
Soil barriers contribute to the low-stature, nutrient-limited vegetation observed on older marine terraces of the Mendocino chronosequence in California ([^Jenny_et+al_1969_a]; see Plate 1), and probably to low nutrient availability in older muskeg sites of the Glacier Bay chronosequence summarized by [^Wardle_et+al_2004_a])

### Transactional P limitation
Most P remains in primary minerals and P availability in soil may be low ([^Crews_et+al_1995_a]).
Where N fixers are abundant early in ecosystem development, as in the Glacier Bay chronosequence and many others, the resultant high N:P ratio of inputs can cause P limitation in young soils ([^Chapin_et+al_1994_a])
The authors term this mechanism transactional P limitation: abundant P is present in parent material, but it weathers slowly enough that P supply constrains plant growth.
This adsorption and precipitation of P could compete with organisms for available P in the short term ([^Olander_2004_a]), and represent an accumulating sink of P in the longer term
Such inorganic sinks drive biological processes toward P limitation in a wide variety of soils, though by differing pathways: for example, by precipitation with Ca in aridland soils or with free iron and aluminum in podsols, or by adsorption onto allophane or sequioxides in many tropical soils ([^Uehara_1981_a]).
This feedback increases the sink, but it could bring other processes to bear, including enhanced mobility of P and N, and potentially loss of contact with underlying mineral-soil horizons

### Anthropogenic P limitation
Just as human activity can transform P-limited ecosystems by adding P ([^Schindler_1977_a]), human activity can induce P limitation by purposefully or inadvertently affecting the supply of other resources, most often N.
The authors call this mechanism anthropogenic P limitation.
Ecological experiments are concentrated in the same areas, and it is possible that much of the P limitation summarized in the metaanalysis by [^Elser_et+al_2007_a]) reflects anthropogenic P limitation secondary to human alteration of the N cycle.
The greater mobility and biological availability of combined N in the atmosphere implies that anthropogenic P limitation should be much more widespread than anthropogenic N limitation

### DISCUSSION
The mechanisms that individually and interactively drive P limitation, together with those driving N limitation, which are summarized in Table 2, could contribute to the understanding of N and P dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems in two ways.
Mechanisms involving depletion, physical barriers, and low-P parent material all depend on the existence of pathways of P loss that continue even where P is limiting to organisms, and which thereby prevent accumulation of biologically available P from very small inputs via continued weathering or dust fluxes ([^Chadwick_et+al_1999_a], [^Okin_et+al_2004_a], [^Soderberg_2007_a]).
Where the supply of P is a major constraint to N fixation, proximate limitation by N can be a manifestation of ultimate limitation by P
For both N and P, understanding the controls of ecosystem mass balances is crucial to identifying and characterizing ultimate limiting nutrients, as Schindler’s studies of lake eutrophication demonstrate ([^Schindler_1977_a]).
Limitation by P or other resources will develop, or become deeper and more widespread

### Findings
All three were on young substrates and supported few N fixers, and all were limited by N more than by P.
Their response to P additions matched their parent material texture; tree growth following P addition was 62% of that following N addition in the low-surface-area pahoehoe site, 28% of the N response in the intermediate-texture a‘a site, and there was no effect of added P in the high surface area cinder site (Fig. 2)

## Findings
- All three were on young substrates and supported few N fixers, and all were limited by N more than by P. Their response to P additions matched their parent material texture; tree growth following P addition was 62% of that following N addition in the low-surface-area pahoehoe site, 28% of the N response in the intermediate-texture a‘a site, and there was no effect of added P in the high surface area cinder site (Fig. 2)

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- While the limits within which N and P can equilibrate are constrained by their different sources, cycles, and dynamics, any process that increases the availability of either N or P makes it more likely that the other element will become limiting. Throughout ==our exploration of mechanisms driving P limitation, we make use of the chronosequences summarized by [^Wardle_et+al_2004_a]); the use of chronosequences forces a long time perspective that is consistent with detecting and characterizing ultimate limiting nutrients==

## Contributions
- We conclude that the most important mechanisms causing ultimate P limitation are those that affect the ecosystem-level mass balance of P. No terrestrial ecosystem is closed, even for a relatively immobile element like P, so an essential component of the maintenance of any low-P terminal steady state is losses of P. Mechanisms involving depletion, physical barriers, and low-P parent material all depend on the existence of pathways of P loss that continue even where P is limiting to organisms, and which thereby prevent accumulation of biologically available P from very small inputs via continued weathering or dust fluxes ([^Chadwick_et+al_1999_a], [^Okin_et+al_2004_a], [^Soderberg_2007_a]). Losses via dissolved organic P could fulfill this condition ([^Hedin_et+al_2003_a]). In effect, the depletion-driven mechanism summarizes the situation during soil development in which losses of P are greater than inputs via weathering and other pathways—until the terminal steady state is reached, and inputs and outputs are both very small. Limitation based on soil barriers works similarly but can develop more rapidly; only processes occurring in the constrained space above the barrier are relevant to terrestrial biota, and these can come to a terminal steady state more rapidly. In parent-material-based limitation, inputs of P are low from the very early stages of soil development onward, and even very small losses of P can offset weathering.

## Limitations
- We are concerned with nutrient limitation (both proximate and ultimate) to many more ecosystems than we will be able to test empirically with fertilization. Indirect measures like element ratios in foliage can be useful predictors of which nutrient is likely to limit particular sites, and so to which anthropogenic changes particular systems are likely to prove most vulnerable. However, the inferences derived from such indices will be much stronger if they are coupled to mechanism-based understanding of why those particular nutrients are limiting to particular ecosystems.
