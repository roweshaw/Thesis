## Abstract
Abstractâ€‚ ==Inducible defense-related proteins have been described in many plant species upon infection== with oomycetes, fungi, bacteria, or viruses, or insect attack. Several types of proteins are common and have been classified into 17 families of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs). Others have so far been found to occur more specifically in some plant species. Most PRs and ==related proteins are induced through the action of the signaling compounds salicylic acid==, jasmonic acid, or ethylene, and possess antimicrobial activities in vitro through hydrolytic activities on cell walls, contact toxicity, and perhaps an involvement in defense signaling. However, when expressed in transgenic plants, they reduce only a limited number of diseases, depending on the nature of the protein, plant species, and pathogen involved. As exemplified by the PR-1 proteins in Arabidopsis and rice, ==many homologous proteins belonging to the same family are regulated== developmentally and may serve different functions in specific organs or tissues. Several ==defense-related proteins are induced during senescence==, wounding or cold stress, and some possess antifreeze activity. Many defense-related proteins are present constitutively in floral tissues and a substantial number of PR-like proteins in pollen, fruits, and vegetables can provoke allergy in humans. The evolutionary conservation of similar defense-related proteins in monocots and dicots, but also their divergent occurrence in other conditions, suggest that these proteins serve essential functions in plant life, whether in defense or not.

## Key points
- Plants possess both preformed and inducible mechanisms to resist pathogen invasion
- Arabidopsis mutants affected in the production or action of the signaling compounds salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), or ethylene (ET) likewise show an enhanced diseasesusceptibility phenotype upon infection by specific pathogens, indicating that these regulators play a role in the basal resistance against these pathogens [^77], [^143]
- Pathogens such as B. cinerea on tobacco and A. brassicicola on Arabidopsis are virtually insensitive to systemic acquired resistance (SAR), but restricted by a different mechanism of induced resistance that is independent of the presence of inducible defense-related proteins in protected tissues [^143], [^146]
- Genes encoding inducible plant defenserelated proteins, PRs, comprise broad, evolutionarily conserved families with individual members differing widely in occurrence and, where known, activity. They likely have an ancient origin with subsequent diversification to serve different functions
- Those proteins that are expressed during plant development in specific stages or organs may, through their specific hydrolytic activities, contribute to the generation of signal molecules that can act as morphogenetic factors, such as chitinase in somatic embyogenesis
- Other PR-like proteins can serve a role in protection of cellular structures against abiotic stress, such as the PR-type proteins with antifreeze activity

## Synopsis

### INTRODUCTION
Plants possess both preformed and inducible mechanisms to resist pathogen invasion. Extant morphological barriers, secondary metabolites (phytoanticipins), and antimicrobial proteins must be avoided or overcome for pathogens to be able to invade a plant.
PR-15 and -16 are typical of monocots and comprise families of germinlike oxalate oxidases and oxalate oxidase-like proteins with superoxide dismutase activity [^8], respectively
These proteins generate hydrogen peroxide that can be toxic to different types of attackers or could directly or indirectly stimulate plant-defense responses (e.g., 34, 62).
PR-10-type proteins are the only family of which all members seem to be cytoplasmic
After their characterization as proteins induced as a result of pathogen or insect attack, many of the same or closely related proteins/mRNAs have been found to be expressed in a developmentally controlled, Systemic acquired resistance (SAR): the phenomenon that plants acquire an enhanced defensive capacity against subsequent pathogen attack as a result of a primary, limited infection www.annualreviews.org Defense-Related Proteins 139.

### Literature Cluster
+ Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip data are constitutively present in storage tissues, such as fruits, seeds, and tubers [^11], [^131].
Closely related homologues of the major extracellular, acidic tobacco PR-1a, -b, and -c are basic proteins [^153]
These findings indicate that PRs that are classified in the same family on the basis of sequence homology can have different properties and, may differ substantially in biological activity.
Neither in tomato nor in tobacco have transgenic plants engineered to constitutively express these proteins been described to possess enhanced resistance against P. infestans
This does not imply that these proteins could not contribute to basal resistance against this pathogen in vivo.
An effective pathogen is likely to have passed into further tissues before the induced proteins become sufficiently active
Their function may be directed more against following invaders, or constitute part of the biochemical barrier raised by SAR against subsequent infections.
Orthologs: related genes in different species www.annualreviews.org Defense-Related Proteins 143

### Literature
The limited effectiveness of the proteins in transgenic plants, as discussed above, and the results that no plant engineered to constitutively express one or more defense-related genes has been shown to be more resistant against viruses, are difficult to reconcile with the generally enhanced defensive capacity of SAR-expressing plants
Pathogens such as B. cinerea on tobacco and A. brassicicola on Arabidopsis are virtually insensitive to SAR, but restricted by a different mechanism of induced resistance that is independent of the presence of inducible defense-related proteins in protected tissues [^143], [^146].
Those proteins appear to be induced through the action of ethylene [^178], indicating a striking parallel with the differential induction of specific PRs in other plant species
Other abiotic stresses, such as heavy metal toxicity, are likely to induce defense-related proteins as a result of the cell-damaging action of the stimulus.

### CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
Genes encoding inducible plant defenserelated proteins, PRs, comprise broad, evolutionarily conserved families with individual members differing widely in occurrence and, where known, activity.
They likely have an ancient origin with subsequent diversification to serve different functions.
Other PR-like proteins can serve a role in protection of cellular structures against abiotic stress, such as the PR-type proteins with antifreeze activity
Whether these are original functions from which an association with defense against pathogens was derived, or the reverse, is unclear.
The details of these systems and the nature of the antimicrobial polypeptides differ substantially between animals and plants, there appears to be a basic similarity in the innate immune responses that allow plants to flourish and them as human beings to exploit and enjoy the world of plants around us

## Study subjects

### 17 families of pathogenesis-related proteins
- Abstractâ€‚ Inducible defense-related proteins have been described in many plant species upon infection with oomycetes, fungi, bacteria, or viruses, or insect attack. ==Several types of proteins are common and have been classified into 17 families of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs)==. Others have so far been found to occur more specifically in some plant species

### 17 families of induced proteins
- Inducible defense-related proteins were first discovered in tobacco reacting hypersensitively to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and later shown to occur in plant species from at least 13 families upon infection by oomycetes, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and viroids, as well as nematode or insect attack [^149]. ==The recognized PRs have been extensively reviewed [^12], [^29], [^72], [^75], [^179] and currently comprise 17 families of induced proteins (Table 1)==. The families are numbered in the order in which they were discovered

### 22 proteins with a predicted PR-1 domain
- Phylogenetic relationships and structural characteristics of predicted PR-1 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. ==All 22 proteins with a predicted PR-1 domain (Pfam code PF00188) encoded by the Arabidopsis genome were aligned with the PR-1-type protein of the fungus Fusarium graminearum (FG02744; not shown) as an outgroup for phylogenetic analysis==. The gene model of AT1G50050 was adjusted (second intron removed) to improve alignment of the translation product to the other proteins

## Findings
- Bootstrap percentages are provided only for branches receiving 60% or more support

##  Confirmation of earlier findings
- In addition, genes encoding seedspecific antimicrobial proteins or glucanases and chitinases of microbial origin have been analyzed in vitro, as well ==as in transgenic plants [^122]. The results obtained corroborate the conclusion that resistance can be enhanced against some pathogens in some plant species==

## Contributions
- <strong>CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES</strong><br/><br/>Genes encoding inducible plant defenserelated proteins, particularly PRs, comprise broad, evolutionarily conserved families with individual members differing widely in occurrence and, where known, activity. Therefore, they likely have an ancient origin with subsequent diversification to serve different functions. Those proteins that are expressed during plant development in specific stages or organs may, through their specific hydrolytic activities, contribute to the generation of signal molecules that can act as morphogenetic factors, such as chitinase in somatic embyogenesis. Some may themselves act as ligands of specific receptors and have a signaling role, as deduced from the occurrence of genes encoding contiguous PR-type-transmembrane-protein kinase domains. Other PR-like proteins can serve a role in protection of cellular structures against abiotic stress, such as the PR-type proteins with antifreeze activity. Whether these are original functions from which an association with defense against pathogens was derived, or the reverse, is unclear. However, their widespread induction upon pathogen attack and their regulation by the defense regulatory hormones SA, JA, and ET suggest that they play an important role in alleviating the effects of attack by pathogens and insects, as well as some forms of abiotic stress. In several instances, quantitative resistance against pathogens has been shown to be associated with constitutively expressed PRs [^84], [^107], [^165]. Adult plants growing in the field without any signs of disease often contain readily detectable levels of PRs (L.C. van Loon, unpublished observations), suggesting that they have experienced stress conditions. There are several reports that apparently nonpathogenic microorganisms present on leaves or in soil can increase activities of, for example, chitinase, glucanase, PAL, peroxidase, and/or polyphenoloxidase systemically in plants [^151]. Therefore, plants seem to constantly adjust their defensive status to the dynamically changing environment.

Whereas in Arabidopsis a distinction between the SA-inducible PR-1, -2, and -5, and the JA/ET-inducible PR-3, -4, and -12 seems clear (143), in tobacco it has been demonstrated that different members within the same protein family are differentially regulated by SA and JA/ET (97, 128). Thus, the acidic PR-1, -2, -3, and -5 proteins, which are inducible by TMV and accumulate in the apoplast, are regulated primarily by SA, with ET and/or JA acting sometimes in a synergistic manner.
