  abstract = {While all species interact with multiple mutualists, the fitness consequences and molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions remain largely unknown. We combined factorial ecological experiments with genome-wide expression analyses to examine the phenotypic and transcriptomic responses of model legume Medicago truncatula to rhizobia and mycorrhizal fungi. We found synergistic effects of these mutualists on plant performance and examined unique features of plant gene expression responses to multiple mutualists. There were genome-wide signatures of mutualists and multiple mutualists on expression, with partners often affecting unique sets of genes. Mycorrhizal fungi had stronger effects on plant expression than rhizobia, with 70\% of differentially expressed genes affected by fungi. Fungal and bacterial mutualists had joint effects on 10\% of differentially expressed genes, including unexpected, non-additive effects on some genes with important functions such as nutrient metabolism. For a subset of genes, interacting with multiple mutualists even led to reversals in the direction of expression (shifts from up to down regulation) compared to interacting with single mutualists. Rhizobia also affected the expression of several mycorrhizal genes, including those involved in nutrient transfer to host plants, indicating that partner species can also impact each other's molecular phenotypes. Collectively, these data illustrate the diverse molecular mechanisms and transcriptional responses associated with the synergistic benefits of multiple mutualists.},

  abstract = {Mycorrhizal symbiosis is a highly evolved mutually beneficial relationship that exists between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) and most of the vascular plants. The majority of the terrestrial plants form association with Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM) or Arbuscular Mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). This symbiosis confers benefits directly to the host plant's growth and development through the acquisition of Phosphorus (P) and other mineral nutrients from the soil by the AMF. In addition, their function ranges from stress alleviation to bioremediation in soils polluted with heavy metals. They may also enhance the protection of plants against pathogens and increases the plant diversity. This is achieved by the growth of AMF mycelium within the host root (intra radical) and out into the soil (extra radical) beyond. Proper management of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal fungi has the potential to improve the profitability and sustainability of agricultural systems. In this review article, the discussion is restricted to the mycorrhizal benefits and their role in sustainable development.},

  abstract = {Most plants are connected belowground via common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). In their presence, the transmission of warning signals from diseased to uninfected plants has been reported. However, current studies have all been conducted in pots making it difficult to discriminate direct from indirect contribution of hyphae to the transmission of the signals. Here, we conducted an in vitro study with potato plantlets connected by a CMN of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. The plantlets were grown in physically separated compartments and their connection ensured only by the CMN. The donor potato plantlets were infected by Phytophthora infestans and defense genes analyzed 24, 48 and 120 h post-infection (hpi) in the uninfected receiver potato plantlets. Twenty-four hpi by the pathogen, PAL, PR-1b, ERF3, and LOX genes were significantly upregulated, whereas no significant transcript variation was noticed 48 and 120 hpi. The exact nature of the warning signals remains unknown but was not associated to microorganisms other than the AMF or to diffusion mechanisms through the growth medium or induced by volatile compounds. The defense response appeared to be transitory and associated with the jasmonic acid or ethylene pathway. These findings demonstrate the direct involvement of hyphae in the transmission of warning signals from diseased to uninfected potato plantlets and their indubitable role in providing a route for activating defense responses in uninfected plants.},

A key motivation for the study of structure based virtual screening is the exploitation of such information to design targeted drugs. In this study, structure based virtual screening was used in search for putative quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The virtual screening programme Glide version 5.5 was applied to screen 1,920 natural compounds/drugs against LasR and RhlR receptor proteins of P. aeruginosa. Based on the results of in silico docking analysis, five top ranking compounds namely rosmarinic acid, naringin, chlorogenic acid, morin and mangiferin were subjected to in vitro bioassays against laboratory strain PAO1 and two more antibiotic resistant clinical isolates, P. aeruginosa AS1 (GU447237) and P. aeruginosa AS2 (GU447238). Among the five compounds studied, except mangiferin other four compounds showed significant inhibition in the production of protease, elastase and hemolysin. Further, all the five compounds potentially inhibited the biofilm related behaviours. This interaction study provided promising ligands to inhibit the quorum sensing (QS) mediated virulence factors production in P. aeruginosa.},

Here, we show that mycorrhizal mycelia can also act as a conduit for signalling between plants, acting as an early warning system for herbivore attack. Insect herbivory causes systemic changes in the production of plant volatiles, particularly methyl salicylate, making bean plants, Vicia faba, repellent to aphids but attractive to aphid enemies such as parasitoids. We demonstrate that these effects can also occur in aphid-free plants but only when they are connected to aphid-infested plants via a common mycorrhizal mycelial network. This underground messaging system allows neighbouring plants to invoke herbivore defences before attack. Our findings demonstrate that common mycorrhizal mycelial networks can determine the outcome of multitrophic interactions by communicating information on herbivore attack between plants, thereby influencing the behaviour of both herbivores and their natural enemies.},

  abstract = {The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is responsible for huge fluxes of photosynthetically fixed carbon from plants to the soil. Carbon is transferred from the plant to the fungus as hexose, but the main form of carbon stored by the mycobiont at all stages of its life cycle is triacylglycerol. Previous isotopic labeling experiments showed that the fungus exports this storage lipid from the intraradical mycelium (IRM) to the extraradical mycelium (ERM). Here, in vivo multiphoton microscopy was used to observe the movement of lipid bodies through the fungal colony and to determine their sizes, distribution, and velocities. The distribution of lipid bodies along fungal hyphae suggests that they are progressively consumed as they move toward growing tips. We report the isolation and measurements of expression of an AM fungal expressed sequence tag that encodes a putative acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase; its deduced amino acid sequence suggests that it may function in the anabolic flux of carbon from lipid to carbohydrate. Time-lapse image sequences show lipid bodies moving in both directions along hyphae and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of labeling patterns after supplying 13C-labeled glycerol to either extraradical hyphae or colonized roots shows that there is indeed significant bidirectional translocation between IRM and ERM. We conclude that large amounts of lipid are translocated within the AM fungal colony and that, whereas net movement is from the IRM to the ERM, there is also substantial recirculation throughout the fungus.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi take up photosynthetically fixed carbon from plant roots and translocate it to their external mycelium. Previous experiments have shown that fungal lipid synthesized from carbohydrate in the root is one form of exported carbon. In this study, an analysis of the labeling in storage and structural carbohydrates after 13C1 glucose was provided to AM roots shows that this is not the only pathway for the flow of carbon from the intraradical to the extraradical mycelium (ERM). Labeling patterns in glycogen, chitin, and trehalose during the development of the symbiosis are consistent with a significant flux of exported glycogen. The identification, among expressed genes, of putative sequences for glycogen synthase, glycogen branching enzyme, chitin synthase, and for the first enzyme in chitin synthesis (glutamine fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase) is reported. The results of quantifying glycogen synthase gene expression within mycorrhizal roots, germinating spores, and ERM are consistent with labeling observations using 13C-labeled acetate and glycerol, both of which indicate that glycogen is synthesized by the fungus in germinating spores and during symbiosis. Implications of the labeling analyses and gene sequences for the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism are discussed, and a 4-fold role for glycogen in the AM symbiosis is proposed: sequestration of hexose taken from the host, long-term storage in spores, translocation from intraradical mycelium to ERM, and buffering of intracellular hexose levels throughout the life cycle.},

The molecular events that constitute critical steps of plant-pathogen interactions seem to involve ligand-receptor mechanisms for pathogen recognition and the induction of signal transduction pathways in the plant that lead to defense responses.

  abstract = {Urinary tract infections (UTIs) primarily affect women and have increasingly become a serious health problem globally. These infections are largely attributed to the quorum sensing (QS)-dependent ability of pathogens to form biofilms in the urinary tract. Microbial pathogenicity can be attenuated by disturbing the QS system of bacteria. The aim of the study was to document the antibacterial and anti-quorum sensing (AQS) potential of medicinal plants that are used as traditional medicine in South Africa to treat UTIs. Of the 70 plant extracts prepared from 14 medicinal plants using solvents of different polarities, only 6 displayed noteworthy activity (MIC {$<$} 1 mg/mL) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Extracts of Hydnora africana, Hypoxis hemerocallidea and Prunus africana displayed good antibacterial activity with MIC value of 0.5 mg/mL against S. aureus, but the methanol extracts of Rhoicissus tridentata and Cryptocarya latifolia were highly active against S. marcescens with MICs of 0.13 and 0.25 mg/mL, respectively. When plant extracts were screened for their ability to inhibit the QS-controlled violacein production by Chromobacterium violaceum, only two species (H. africana and C. latifolia) exhibited AQS activity in the qualitative agar well diffusion assay. However, eight extracts inhibited violacein production by 57\textendash 71\% in the quantitative dilution assay. The ability of uropathogens to form biofilms upon exposure to the plant extracts was subsequently investigated using the crystal violet assay. It was found that the polar extracts of Cenchrus ciliaris and Eucomis autumnalis, Ranunculus multifidus, Vernonia adoensis, Cryptocarya latifolia, Hydnora africana, Rhoicissus tridentata and Hypoxis hemerocallidea, as well as non-polar extracts of Prunus africana and Hypoxis hemerocallidea were able to reduce initial cell attachment of S. aureus, P. mirabilis and S. marcescens by approximately 50\%. However, the preformed biofilm was inhibited less than 30\% by the extracts. The study revealed that several South African medicinal plants have antibacterial and AQS properties, validating their use in traditional medicines to treat UTIs to some degree, and indicating that they may be a suitable source of anti-pathogenic drugs to treat urinary infections.},

To resolve this conflict we grew Plantago lanceolata L. inoculated with Glomus hoi (UY 110) in microcosm units maintained at 12/10\textdegree C (day/night). The microcosms had two compartments, one planted and one not. The root-free compartment contained either an organic (15N:13C labelled milled shoot material) or a sand patch. When permitted access, G. hoi proliferated hyphae extensively in the organic patch material. Plant 15N content was a simple function of length density of extra-radical mycelium (ERM) in the patch and c. 6\% of host plant N was derived from the patch. These results indicate that G. hoi not only grew at these realistic soil temperatures, but also conferred a nutritional benefit to its host.},

Common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) form belowground networks that interconnect multiple plant species; yet these networks are typically ignored in studies of allelopathy. We tested the hypothesis that CMNs facilitate transport of allelochemicals from supplier to target plants, thereby affecting allelopathic interactions. We analyzed accumulation of a model allelopathic substance, the herbicide imazamox, and two allelopathic thiophenes released from Tagetes tenuifolia roots, by diffusion through soil and CMNs. We also conducted bioassays to determine how the accumulated substances affected plant growth. All compounds accumulated to greater levels in target soils with CMNs as opposed to soils without CMNs. This increased accumulation was associated with reduced growth of target plants in soils with CMNs. Our results show that CMNs support transfer of allelochemicals from supplier to target plants and thus lead to allelochemical accumulation at levels that could not be reached by diffusion through soil alone. We conclude that CMNs expand the bioactive zones of allelochemicals in natural environments, with significant implications for interspecies chemical interactions in plant communities.},

Climate change and agricultural malpractices like excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides have aggravated the effects of abiotic stresses on crop productivity and degraded the ecosystem. There is an urgent need for environment-friendly management techniques such as the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for enhancing crop productivity. AMF are commonly known as bio-fertilizers. Moreover, it is widely believed that the inoculation of AMF provides tolerance to host plants against various stressful situations like heat, salinity, drought, metals, and extreme temperatures. AMF may both assist host plants in the up-regulation of tolerance mechanisms and prevent the down-regulation of key metabolic pathways. AMF, being natural root symbionts, provide essential plant inorganic nutrients to host plants, thereby improving growth and yield under unstressed and stressed regimes. The role of AMF as a bio-fertilizer can potentially strengthen plants' adaptability to changing environment. Thus, further research focusing on the AMF-mediated promotion of crop quality and productivity is needed. The present review provides a comprehensive up-to-date knowledge on AMF and their influence on host plants at various growth stages, their advantages and applications, and consequently the importance of the relationships of different plant nutrients with AMF.},

Also bacteria and nematodes need to degrade the plant cell wall at a certain stage of their infection process, to obtain nutrients for their growth. Plants have developed a system for sensing pathogens and monitoring the cell wall integrity, upon which they activate defense responses that lead to a dynamic cell wall remodeling required to prevent the disease. Pathogens, on the other hand, may exploit the host cell wall metabolism to support the infection. We review here the strategies utilized by both plants and pathogens to prevail in the cell wall battleground.},

Previous studies have shown that roots secrete a branching factor (BF) that strongly stimulates branching of hyphae during germination of the spores of AM fungi. In the BF of Lotus, a strigolactone was found to be the active molecule. Strigolactones are known as germination stimulants of the parasitic plants Striga and Orobanche. In this paper, we show that the BF of a monocotyledonous plant, Sorghum, also contains a strigolactone. Strigolactones strongly and rapidly stimulated cell proliferation of the AM fungus Gigaspora rosea at concentrations as low as 10-13 M. This effect was not found with other sesquiterperne lactones known as germination stimulants of parasitic weeds. Within 1 h of treatment, the density of mitochondria in the fungal cells increased, and their shape and movement changed dramatically. Strigolactones stimulated spore germination of two other phylogenetically distant AM fungi, Glomus intraradices and Gl. claroideum. This was also associated with a rapid increase of mitochondrial density and respiration as shown with Gl. intraradices. We conclude that strigolactones are important rhizospheric plant signals involved in stimulating both the pre-symbiotic growth of AM fungi and the germination of parasitic plants.},

The plants, nodulating or nonnodulating isolines of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], were grown in association with a dwarf maize (Zea mays L.) cultivar in containers which interposed a 6-cm-wide root-free soil bridge between legume and grass container compartments. The bridge was delimited by screens (44 {$\mu$}m) which permitted the passage of hyphae, but not of roots and minimized non VAM interactions between the plants. All plants were colonized by the VAM fungus Glomus mosseae (Nicol. \& Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe. The effects of N input to N-sufficient soybean plants through N2-fixation or N-fertilization on associated maize-plant growth and nutrition were compared to those of an N-deficient (nonnodulating, unfertilized) soybean control. Maize, when associated with the N-fertilized soybean, increased 19\% in biomass, 67\% in N content and 77\% in leaf N concentration relative to the maize plants of the N-deficient association. When maize was grown with nodulated soybean, maize N content increased by 22\%, biomass did not change, but P content declined by 16\%. Spore production by the VAM fungus was greatest in the soils of both plants of the N-fertilized treatment. The patterns of N and P distribution, as well as those of the other essential elements, indicated that association with the N-fertilized soybean plants was more advantageous to maize than was association with the N2-fixing ones.},

Of particular economic importance is the role of ethylene as an inducer of fruit ripening. Ethylene is synthesized from S-adenosyl-L-methionine via 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). The enzymes catalyzing the two reactions in this pathway are ACC synthase and ACC oxidase. Environmental and endogenous signals regulate ethylene biosynthesis primarily through differential expression of ACC synthase genes. Components of the ethylene signal transduction pathway have been identified by characterization of ethylene-response mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. One class of mutations, exemplified by etr1, led to the identification of the ethylene receptors, which turned out to be related to bacterial two-component signaling systems. Mutations that eliminate ethylene binding to the receptor yield a dominant, ethylene-insensitive phenotype. CTR1 encodes a Raf-like Ser/Thr protein kinase that acts downstream from the ethylene receptor and may be part of a MAP kinase cascade. Mutants in CTR1 exhibit a constitutive ethylene-response phenotype. Both the ethylene receptors and CTR1 are negative regulators of ethylene responses. EIN2 and EIN3 are epistatic to CTR1, and mutations in either gene lead to ethylene insensitivity. Whereas the function of EIN2 in ethylene transduction is not known, EIN3 is a putative transcription factor involved in regulating expression of ethylene-responsive genes. Biotechnological modifications of ethylene synthesis and of sensitivity to ethylene are promising methods to prevent spoilage of agricultural products such as fruits, whose ripening is induced by ethylene.},

The qualitative and quantitative composition of these compounds depends on the presence of exogeneous tryptophan and on the nitrogen source. The highest IAA yield was obtained at the stationary phase of growth. Addition of L-tryptophan to the medium resulted in a significant increase (up to 85.5 microg/mL) of auxin biosynthesis, especially in the presence of nitrates. Thin-layer chromatography revealed that the indole-3-acetamide pathway was not active in this strain. The biological activity of auxins was confirmed by plant assay with the kidney bean cuttings; the height of root formation and rdot number increased 16- and 6-fold, respectively. Under conditions of low-temperature stress, protective effect of K. planticola TSKhA-91 on development of cucumbers (Cucumissativus L.) seeds, including stimulation of germi- nation and root formation by its seeds were shown.},

  abstract = {Two glasshouse experiments were performed to assess the development and metabolic activity of mycorrhizas formed by isolates of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from three different genera, Acaulospora, Gigaspora and Glomus on Desmodium ovalifolium L. plants. In the first experiment the effect of disturbance of a preestablished extra-radical mycelium (ERM) was studied. In the second experiment the effect of phosphate addition as either organic matter (OM) or fertiliser was studied. Disturbance of a pre-established ERM reduced the formation of mycorrhizas by Gigaspora rosea (BEG111) and increased that by Glomus manihotis (BEG112) on D. ovalifolium plants. Acaulospora tuberculata (BEG41) failed to form mycorrhizas in the experiment. Either Gi. rosea (BEG111) or G. manihotis (BEG112) appeared to be the major component of the colonisation resulting from treatments with combinations of two or three of the AMF and determined the sensitivity of these treatments to disturbance of a pre-established ERM. The addition of phosphate fertiliser (10 mg P kg-1) reduced mycorrhiza formation by each species of AMF compared with the addition of OM (10 mg P kg-1). This work indicates that AMF from different genera respond differently to management by agricultural practices when in association with a tropical legume. Clearly, there is potential to alter the formation of mycorrhizas of AMF from different genera, through the use of agricultural practices. The significance of the development and metabolic activity of mycorrhizas formed by AMF from different genera for plant growth is discussed.},

Traits for ranking species rapidly according to these three criteria are indicated. Analysis of case studies suggests that plants often compensate for high risk in one of the three categories by low risk in another. For example, self-incompatible plants with rare specialist pollinators often propagate vegetatively. Some systems, including elements of the Cape flora and lowland tropical rain forest, lack compensatory traits and the risk of plant extinction from failes mutualism is high.},

Frank and G. Gibelli described the surprisingly morphology of forest tree roots surrounded by a fungal mantle. Compared with this history, our molecular study of mycorrhizas remains a young science. To trace the history of mycorrhizal research, from its roots in the distant past, to the present and the future, this review outlines a few topics that were already central in the 19th century and were seminal in revealing the biological meaning of mycorrhizal associations. These include investigations of nutrient exchange between partners, plant responses to mycorrhizal fungi, and the identity and evolution of mycorrhizal symbionts as just a few examples of how the most recent molecular studies of mycorrhizal biology sprouted from the roots of past research. In addition to clarifying the ecological role of mycorrhizas, some of the recent results have changed the perception of the relevance of mycorrhizas in the scientific community, and in the whole of society. Looking to past knowledge while foreseeing strategies for the next steps can help us catch a glimpse of the future of mycorrhizal research.},

We then discuss, in the context of nutritional strategies, the mechanisms that operate among members of the consortium and that often promote plant growth. Release of active molecules, including volatiles, and physical contact among the partners seem important for the establishment of the bacteria/mycorrhizal fungus/plant network.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Photosynthetic organisms convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into numerous metabolites along the pathways to make new biomass. Aquatic photosynthetic organisms, which fix almost half of global inorganic carbon, have great potential: as a carbon dioxide fixation method, for the economical production of chemicals, or as a source for lipids and starch which can then be converted to biofuels. To harness this potential through metabolic engineering and to maximize production, a more thorough understanding of photosynthetic metabolism must first be achieved. A model algal species, C. reinhardtii, was chosen and the metabolic network reconstructed. Intracellular fluxes were then calculated using flux balance analysis (FBA).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The metabolic network of primary metabolism for a green alga, C. reinhardtii, was reconstructed using genomic and biochemical information. The reconstructed network accounts for the intracellular localization of enzymes to three compartments and includes 484 metabolic reactions and 458 intracellular metabolites. Based on BLAST searches, one newly annotated enzyme (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) was added to the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii database. FBA was used to predict metabolic fluxes under three growth conditions, autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth. Biomass yields ranged from 28.9 g per mole C for autotrophic growth to 15 g per mole C for heterotrophic growth.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: The flux balance analysis model of central and intermediary metabolism in C. reinhardtii is the first such model for algae and the first model to include three metabolically active compartments. In addition to providing estimates of intracellular fluxes, metabolic reconstruction and modelling efforts also provide a comprehensive method for annotation of genome databases. As a result of our reconstruction, one new enzyme was annotated in the database and several others were found to be missing; implying new pathways or non-conserved enzymes. The use of FBA to estimate intracellular fluxes also provides flux values that can be used as a starting point for rational engineering of C. reinhardtii. From these initial estimates, it is clear that aerobic heterotrophic growth on acetate has a low yield on carbon, while mixotrophically and autotrophically grown cells are significantly more carbon efficient.},

Transfer of mineral nutrients occurs at the interface between branched hyphae called arbuscules and root cortical cells. In Medicago truncatula, a Pi transporter, PT4, is required for symbiotic Pi transport, and in pt4, symbiotic Pi transport fails, arbuscules degenerate prematurely, and the symbiosis is not maintained. Premature arbuscule degeneration (PAD) is suppressed when pt4 mutants are nitrogen-deprived, possibly the result of compensation by PT8, a second AM-induced Pi transporter. However, PAD is also suppressed in nitrogen-starved pt4 pt8 double mutants, negating this hypothesis and furthermore indicating that in this condition, neither of these symbiotic Pi transporters is required for symbiosis. In M. truncatula, three AMT2 family ammonium transporters are induced during AM symbiosis. To test the hypothesis that suppression of PAD involves AMT2 transporters, we analyzed double and triple Pi and ammonium transporter mutants. ATM2;3 but not AMT2;4 was required for suppression of PAD in pt4, while AMT2;4, but not AMT2;3, complemented growth of a yeast ammonium transporter mutant. In summary, arbuscule life span is influenced by PT4 and ATM2;3, and their relative importance varies with the nitrogen status of the plant.},

The contribution of the AM symbiosis to the phosphate nutrition has long been known, but whether AM fungi contribute similarly to the nitrogen nutrition of their host is still controversially discussed. However, there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that AM fungi can actively transfer nitrogen to their host, and that the host plant with its carbon supply stimulates this transport, and that the periarbuscular membrane of the host is able to facilitate the active uptake of nitrogen from the mycorrhizal interface. In this review, our current knowledge about nitrogen transport through the fungal hyphae and across the mycorrhizal interface is summarized, and we discuss the regulation of these pathways and major research gaps.},

This fraction, isolated on the basis of its activity on hyphal branching, contains a root factor (one or several molecules) that stimulates, directly or indirectly, G. gigantea nuclear division. We demonstrate the presence of this active factor in root exudates of all mycotrophic plant species tested (eight species) but not in those of nonhost plant species (four species).

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered the most important type of mycorrhizae for phytoremediation. AMF have broad occurrence in contaminated soils, and evidences suggest they improve plant tolerance to excess of certain trace elements. In this review, the use of AMF in phytoremediation and mechanisms involved in their trace element tolerance are discussed.

Release from these specialist enemies is also thought by some to lead to the evolution of increased competitive ability, driven by a decrease in the plant's resource allocation to consumer defense and an increase in allocation to size or fecundity. Here, we discuss a new theory for invasive success - the "novel weapons hypothesis". We propose that some invaders transform because they possess novel biochemical weapons that function as unusually powerful allelopathic agents, or as mediators of new plant-soil microbial interactions. Root exudates that are relatively ineffective against their natural neighbors because of adaptation, may be highly inhibitory to newly encountered plants in invaded communities. In other words, the novel weapons of some plant invaders provide them with an advantage that may arise from differences in the regional coevolutionary trajectories of plant communities. Furthermore, the selective advantage of possessing a novel weapon may result in rapid evolution of that weapon - for example, the production of greater quantities of allelopathic or antimicrobial root exudates. Direct selection of competitive traits provides an alternative to the "grow versus defend" trade-offs that underpin the theory of the evolution of increased competitive ability.},

  abstract = {The role that common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) play in plant-to-plant transfer of zinc (Zn) has not yet been investigated, despite the proved functions of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in crop Zn acquisition. Here, two autotrophic Medicago truncatula plants were linked by a CMN formed by Rhizophagus irregularis. Plants were grown in vitro in physically separated compartments (Donor-C and Receiver-C) and their connection ensured only by CMN. A symbiosis-defective mutant of M. truncatula was used as control in Receiver-C. Plants in both compartments were grown on Zn-free medium, and only the leaves of the donor plants were Zn fertilized. A direct transfer of Zn was demonstrated from donor leaves to receiver shoots mediated by CMN. Direct transfer of Zn was supported by changes in the expression of fungal genes, RiZRT1 and RiZnT1, and plant gene MtZIP2 in roots and MtNAS1 in roots and shoots of the receiver plants. Moreover, Zn transfer was supported by the change in expression of MtZIP14 gene in AM fungal colonized roots. This work is the first evidence of a direct Zn transfer from a donor to a receiver plant via CMN, and of a triggering of transcriptional regulation of fungal-plant genes involved in Zn transport-related processes.},

  abstract = {Roots of legumes establish symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nodule-inducing rhizobia. The existing nodules systemically suppress subsequent nodule formation in other parts of the root, a phenomenon termed autoregulation. Similarly, mycorrhizal roots reduce further AMF colonization on other parts of the root system. In this work, split- root systems of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) were used to study the autoregulation of symbiosis with Sinorhizobium meliloti and the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae. It is shown that nodulation systemically influences AMF root colonization and vice versa. Nodules on one half of the split-root system suppressed subsequent AMF colonization on the other half. Conversely, root systems pre-colonized on one side by AMF exhibited reduced nodule formation on the other side. An inhibition effect was also observed with Nod factors (lipo-chito-oligosaccharides). NodSm-IV(C16:2, S) purified from S. meliloti systemically suppressed both nodule formation and AMF colonization. The application of Nod factors, however, did not influence the allocation of 14C within the split-root system, excluding competition for carbohydrates as the regulatory mechanism. These results indicate a systemic regulatory mechanism in the rhizobial and the arbuscular mycorrhizal association, which is similar in both symbioses.},

The distribution of nutrients in soils is typically patchy (heterogeneous) but little is known about the ability of AMF to exploit P patches in soil. This was studied by growing symbioses of Linum usitatissimum and three AMF (Glomus intraradices, G. mosseae and Gigaspora margarita) in pots with two side-arms, which were accessible to hyphae, but not to roots. Soil in one side-arm was either unamended (P0) or enriched with P; simultaneous labelling of this soil with 32P revealed that G. intraradices responded to P enrichment both in terms of hyphal proliferation and P uptake, whereas the other AMF did not. Labelling with 33P of P0 soil in the other side arm revealed that the increased P uptake by G. intraradices from the P-enriched patch was paralleled by decreased P uptake by other parts of the mycelium. This is the first demonstration of variation in growth and nutrient uptake by an AMF as influenced by a localized P enrichment of the soil. The results are discussed in the context of functional diversity of AMF.},

These losses can be environmentally damaging and expensive in terms of lost agricultural production. Plants have evolved many traits to optimize nutrient acquisition, including the formation of arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations of plant roots with fungi that acquire soil nutrients. There is emerging evidence that AM have the ability to reduce nutrient loss from soils by enlarging the nutrient interception zone and preventing nutrient loss after rain-induced leaching events. Until recently, this important ecosystem service of AM had been largely overlooked. Here we review the role of AM in reducing nutrient loss and conclude that this role cannot be ignored if we are to increase global food production in an environmentally sustainable manner.},

The way in which these molecules favour the invasion of plant tissues and the development of fungi inside plant tissues is still largely unknown. In this review, we examine the different roles of such hormone production by pathogenic fungi. Converging evidence suggests that these fungal-derived molecules have potentially two modes of action: (i) they may perturb plant processes, either positively or negatively, to favour invasion and nutrient uptake; and (ii) they may also act as signals for the fungi themselves to engage appropriate developmental and physiological processes adapted to their environment. Indirect evidence suggests that abscisic acid, gibberellic acid and ethylene produced by fungi participate in pathogenicity. There is now evidence that auxin and cytokinins could be positive regulators required for virulence. Further research should establish whether or not fungal-derived hormones act like other fungal effectors.},

A weighted meta-analysis was conducted to study the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation in alleviating salt stress in C3 and C4 plants. We analyzed the salt stress influence on seven independent variables such as chlorophyll, leaf area, photosynthetic rate (Amax), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (E), relative water content (RWC), and water use efficiency (WUE) on AMF inoculated plants. Responses were compared between C3 and C4 plants, AMF species, plant functional groups, level of salinity, and environmental conditions. Our results showed that AMF inoculated plants had a positive impact on gas exchange and water status under salt stress. The total chlorophyll contents of C3 plants were higher than C4 plants. However, C3 plants responses regarding Gs, Amax, and E were more positive compared to C4 plants. The increase in G s mainly maintained E and it explains the increase in Amax and increase in E. When the two major AMF species (Rhizophagus intraradices and Funnelliformis mosseae) were considered, the effect sizes of RWC and WUE in R. intraradices were lower than those in F. mosseae indicating that F. mosseae inoculated plants performed better under salt stress. In terms of C3 and C4 plant photosynthetic pathways, the effect size of C4 was lower than C3 plants indicating that AMF inoculation more effectively alleviated salt stress in C3 compared to C4 plants.},

We first critically assess the evidence for the existence of self/non-self and kin recognition at the root level in plants. While root identity recognition most likely exists to some degree, there remain valid points of criticism regarding experiments that have documented this, particularly concerning the effects of pot volume in self/non-self recognition experiments and the roles of size inequality and asymmetric competition in kin recognition studies. Subsequently we review and propose some plausible physiological mechanisms that may underlie these responses. Finally we briefly discuss the relation between under- and aboveground interactions and the potential consequences of root identity recognition for agriculture, and conclude with raising several questions for future studies.},

Roots of both grapevines and cover crops form mutualistic symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and may be interconnected by AM hyphae. To study nutrient transfer from cover crops to grapevines through AM fungal links, we grew grapevines and cover crops in specially designed containers in the greenhouse that restricted their root systems to separate compartments, but allowed AM fungi to colonize both root systems. Leaves of two cover crops, a grass (Bromus hordeaceus) and a legume (Medicago polymorpha), were labeled with 99 atom\% 15N solution for 24~h. Grapevine leaves were analyzed for 15N content 2, 5, and 10 days after labeling. Our results showed evidence of AM fungi-mediated 15N transfer from cover crops to grapevines 5 and 10 days after labeling. N transfer was significantly greater from the grass to the grapevine than from the legume to the grapevine. Possible reasons for the differences between the two cover crops include lower 15N enrichment in legume roots, higher biomass of grass roots, and/or differences in AM fungal community composition. Further studies are needed to investigate N transfer from grapevines to cover crops and to determine net N transfer between the two crops throughout their growing seasons, in order to understand the significance of AM fungi-mediated interplant nutrient transfers in the field.},

However, it is still unknown whether nutrient transfer through the common mycorrhizal networks (CMN) between this exotic species and the native species enhances the competitive growth of F. bidentis over the native species. To elucidate this question and the related mechanism, an isotopic labeling technique was used to test the transfer of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) by CMN. Native species like Setaria viridis and Eclipta prostrata were selected to compete with F. bidentis in a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) box. Two competitive groups (F. bidentis-S. viridis and F. bidentis- E. prostrata), three treatments (monoculture of F. bidentis, the mixture of F. bidentis and the native plant, and the monoculture of the native plant), and two levels of AMF (presence or absence) were assigned. Results showed that the corrected index of relative competition intensity (CRCI) of F. bidentis in the presence of AMF {$<$} 0 suggests that the competition facilitated the growth of F. bidentis with either S. viridis or E. prostrata. The reason was that the inoculation of R. intra radices significantly increased the C and N contents of F. bidentis in the mixtures. However, the effects of R. intra radices on the two native species were different: negative effect on the growth of S. viridis and positive effect on the growth of E. prostrata. The change of N content in S. viridis or E. prostrata was consistent with the variation of the biomass, suggesting that the N uptake explains the effects of R. intraradices on the competitive interactions between F. bidentis and the two native species. Moreover, the transfer of C and N via AMF hyphal links did occur between F. bidentis and the native species. However, the transfer of C and N by the CMN was not positively related to the competitive growth of F. bidentis.},

In Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 31532 a number of phenotypic characteristics, including production of the purple pigment violacein, hydrogen cyanide, antibiotics, and exoproteases are known to be regulated by the endogenous AHL N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (HHL). In this study we show that C. violaceum produces a set of chitinolytic enzymes whose production is regulated by HHL. The chitinolytic activity was induced in strains grown in the presence of chitin as the sole carbon source and quantitated in the secreted proteins by using p-nitrophenol analogs of disaccharide, trisaccharide, and tetrasaccharide oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine. By using 4-methylumbelliferyl analogs of the same oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine as substrates for proteins separated and renatured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, at least six enzymes were detected: a chitobiase with high specificity to a dimeric substrate of 87 kDa, two N-acetylglucosaminidases with apparent molecular masses of 162 and 133 kDa, two endochitinases of 108 and 67 kDa, and a chitobiosidase of 56 kDa. In addition, two unidentified bands of {$>$}205 kDa were found where a tetrameric chitin derivative was used as a substrate. A pleiotropic mini-Tn5 mutant of C. violaceum (CV026) that is defective in HHL production and other quorum-sensing-regulated factors was also found to be completely deficient in chitinolytic activity. Growth of this mutant on minimal medium with chitin supplemented with culture supernatant from the C. violaceum wild-type strain or 10 microM synthetic HHL restored chitinase production to the level shown by the parental strain. These results constitute the most complete evidence so far for regulation of chitinolytic activity by AHL signaling in a gram-negative bacterium.},

  abstract = {Land-adapted plants appeared between about 480 and 360 million years ago in the mid-Palaeozoic era, originating from charophycean green algae. The successful adaptation to land of these prototypes of amphibious plants - when they emerged from an aquatic environment onto the land - was achieved largely by massive formation of "phenolic UV light screens". In the course of evolution, plants have developed the ability to produce an enormous number of phenolic secondary metabolites, which are not required in the primary processes of growth and development but are of vital importance for their interaction with the environment, for their reproductive strategy and for their defense mechanisms.From a biosynthetic point of view, beside methylation catalyzed by O-methyltransferases, acylation and glycosylation of secondary metabolites, including phenylpropanoids and various derived phenolic compounds, are fundamental chemical modifications. Such modified metabolites have altered polarity, volatility, chemical stability in cells but also in solution, ability for interaction with other compounds (co-pigmentation) and biological activity.The control of the production of plant phenolics involves a matrix of potentially overlapping regulatory signals. These include developmental signals, such as during lignification of new growth or the production of anthocyanins during fruit and flower development, and environmental signals for protection against abiotic and biotic stresses. For some of the key compounds, such as the flavonoids, there is now an excellent understanding of the nature of those signals and how the signal transduction pathway connects through to the activation of the phenolic biosynthetic genes.Within the plant environment, different microorganisms can coexist that can establish various interactions with the host plant and that are often the basis for the synthesis of specific phenolic metabolites in response to these interactions. In the rhizosphere, increasing evidence suggests that root specific chemicals (exudates) might initiate and manipulate biological and physical interactions between roots and soil organisms. These interactions include signal traffic between roots of competing plants, roots and soil microbes, and one-way signals that relate the nature of chemical and physical soil properties to the roots. Plant phenolics can also modulate essential physiological processes such as transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. Some interesting effects of plant phenolics are also the ones associated with the growth hormone auxin. An additional role for flavonoids in functional pollen development has been observed. Finally, anthocyanins represent a class of flavonoids that provide the orange, red and blue/purple colors to many plant tissues. According to the coevolution theory, red is a signal of the status of the tree to insects that migrate to (or move among) the trees in autumn. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Plants capable of this symbiosis can obtain up to all of the phosphate from symbiotic fungi, and this offers potential means to develop crops less dependent on unsustainable P fertilizers. Here, we review the mechanisms and insights gleaned from the fine-tuned signal exchanges that orchestrate the intimate mutualistic symbiosis between plants and AMF. As the currency of trade, nutrients have signaling functions beyond being the nutritional goal of mutualism. We propose that such signaling roles and metabolic reprogramming may represent commitments for a mutualistic symbiosis that act across the stages of symbiosis development.},

We tested whether partners have symmetrical (`fair') or asymmetrical (`unfair') bargaining power in a legume\textendash rhizobia nitrogen-fixing symbiosis using measurements of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in a mathematical modeling framework derived from economic theory. A model of symmetric bargaining power was not consistent with our data. Instead, our data indicate that the growth benefit to the plant (Medicago truncatula) has greater weight in determining trade dynamics than the benefit to the bacteria. Quantitative estimates of the relative power of the plant revealed that the plant's influence rises as soil nitrogen availability decreases and trade benefits to both partners increase. Our finding that M. truncatula legumes have more bargaining power than their rhizobial partner at lower nitrogen availabilities highlights the importance of context-dependence for the evolution of mutualism with increasing nutrient deposition.},

It assumes that parasites become specialized on common host genotypes, reducing their fitness. Such frequency-dependent selection favors sexual reproduction in host populations. Necessary conditions are that resistance and virulence are genotype specific so that host genotype frequencies respond to changes in pathogen genotype frequencies, and vice versa. Empirical evidence on the genetic basis of disease, variation in resistance and virulence, and patterns of infection in sexual and asexual plants support certain features of the hypothesis. However, gene-for-gene interactions are generally not consistent with the RQH because they do not result in cycling of gene frequencies, unlike a matching allele mechanism. A conclusion of whether the RQH can explain the maintenance of sexual reproduction cannot be reached at present. Nevertheless, the RQH theory has shed light on many aspects of plant/pathogen interactions important for reducing pathogen damage in agricultural systems.},

There are numerous approaches to calculate NUE, but it is difficult to find an authoritative resource that collates the various NUE indices and systematically identifies their assets and shortcomings. Furthermore, there is reason to question the usefulness of many traditional NUE formulations, and to consider factors to improve the conceptualization of NUE for future use. As a resource for agricultural researchers and students, here we present a comprehensive list of NUE indices and discuss their functions, strengths, and limitations. We also suggest several factors\textemdash which are currently ignored in traditional NUE indices\textemdash that will improve the conceptualization of NUE, such as: accounting for a wider range of soil N forms, considering how plants mediate their response to the soil N status, including the below-ground/root N pools, capturing the synchrony between available N and plant N demand, blending agronomic performance with ecosystem functioning, and affirming the biological meaning of NUE.},

Homoserine lactone (HSL) molecules function as quorum-sensing signals for Gram-negative bacteria. Plants also produce previously unidentified compounds that affect quorum sensing. We identified rosmarinic acid as a plant-derived compound that functioned as an HSL mimic. In vitro assays showed that rosmarinic acid bound to the quorum-sensing regulator RhlR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and competed with the bacterial ligand N-butanoyl-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). Furthermore, rosmarinic acid stimulated a greater increase in RhlR-mediated transcription in vitro than that of C4-HSL. In P. aeruginosa, rosmarinic acid induced quorum sensing-dependent gene expression and increased biofilm formation and the production of the virulence factors pyocyanin and elastase. Because P. aeruginosa PAO1 infection induces rosmarinic acid secretion from plant roots, our results indicate that rosmarinic acid secretion is a plant defense mechanism to stimulate a premature quorum-sensing response. P. aeruginosa is a ubiquitous pathogen that infects plants and animals; therefore, identification of rosmarinic acid as an inducer of premature quorum-sensing responses may be useful in agriculture and inform human therapeutic strategies.},

Mycorrhiza was established between transformed carrot (Daucus carota) roots and Glomus intraradices in two-compartment petri dishes and three ammonium levels were supplied to the compartment containing the extraradical mycelium (ERM), but no roots. Time courses of specific enzyme activity were obtained for glutamine synthetase, argininosuccinate synthetase, arginase, and urease in the ERM and AM roots. 15NH4 ~+ was used to follow the dynamics of nitrogen incorporation into and turnover of Arg. Both the absence of external nitrogen and the presence of l-norvaline, an inhibitor of Arg synthesis, prevented the synthesis of Arg in the ERM and resulted in decreased activity of arginase and urease in the AM root. The catabolic activity of the urea cycle in the roots therefore depends on Arg translocation from the ERM. 15N labeling of Arg in the ERM was very fast and analysis of its time course and isotopomer pattern allowed estimation of the translocation rate of Arg along the mycelium as 0.13 {$\mu$}g Arg mg-1 fresh weight h-1. The results highlight the synchronization of the spatially separated reactions involved in the anabolic and catabolic arms of the urea cycle. This synchronization is a prerequisite for Arg to be a key component in nitrogen translocation in the AM mycelium.},

  abstract = {Plants support a diverse array of bacteria, including parasites, mutualists, and commensals on and around their roots, in the vasculature, and on aerial tissues. These microbes have a profound influence on plant health and productivity. Bacteria physically interact with surfaces to form complex multicellular and often multispecies assemblies, including biofilms and smaller aggregates. There is growing appreciation that the intensity, duration, and outcome of plant-microbe interactions are significantly influenced by the conformation of adherent microbial populations. Biofilms on different tissues have unique properties, reflecting the prevailing conditions at those sites. Attachment is required for biofilm formation, and bacteria interact with plant tissues through adhesins including polysaccharides and surface proteins, with initial contact often mediated by active motility. Recognition between lectins and their cognate carbohydrates is a common means of specificity. Biofilm development and the resulting intimate interactions with plants often require cell-cell communication between colonizing bacteria.},

  abstract = {Using the most probable number method, differences in inoculum potential between six vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungal isolates were demonstrated. Inoculum of Glomus mosseae had the highest inoculum potential while G. constrictus, and G. fasciculatus isolate 92, and isolate 0\textendash 1 were approximately 1/5, 1/6 and 1/12 as effective. G. fasciculatus isolate 185 and G. epigaeus were approximately 1 /50 as effective. These differences were not correlated with differences in spore viability or germinability since approximately 75 \% germination occurred in all species after 3 weeks. While G. mosseae has the largest spore size and had the highest inoculum potential, no further correlation between spore size and inoculum potential was observed. The rate of increase of infection by these six VA mycorrhizal fungi differed more when equal spore numbers were used as inoculum than when equalized inoculum potentials were used. The percentage root infection, subjected to the multiple infection correction, was regressed against log of inoculum density and yielded slopes of 063 to 070 for all VA mycorrhizal fungi tested. The inoculum density-infection relationships of mycorrhizal fungi are discussed with respect to Baker's epidemiological models.},

Antisense expression of a heterologous French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) peroxidase (FBP1) cDNA in Arabidopsis thaliana was previously shown to diminish the expression of two Arabidopsis peroxidases (peroxidase 33 [PRX33] and PRX34), block the oxidative burst in response to a fungal elicitor, and cause enhanced susceptibility to a broad range of fungal and bacterial pathogens. Here we show that mature leaves of T-DNA insertion lines with diminished expression of PRX33 and PRX34 exhibit reduced ROS and callose deposition in response to microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), including the synthetic peptides Flg22 and Elf26 corresponding to bacterial flagellin and elongation factor Tu, respectively. PRX33 and PRX34 knockdown lines also exhibited diminished activation of Flg22-activated genes after Flg22 treatment. These MAMP-activated genes were also downregulated in unchallenged leaves of the peroxidase knockdown lines, suggesting that a low level of apoplastic ROS production may be required to preprime basal resistance. Finally, the PRX33 knockdown line is more susceptible to Pseudomonas syringae than wild-type plants. In aggregate, these data demonstrate that the peroxidase-dependent oxidative burst plays an important role in Arabidopsis basal resistance mediated by the recognition of MAMPs.},

This trend will continue as investigators realize that stable isotopes can serve as valuable nonradioactive tracers and nondestructive integrators of how plants today and in the past have interacted with and responded to their abiotic and biotic environments. At the center of nearly all plant ecological research which has made use of stable isotope methods are the notions of interactions and the resources that mediate or influence them. Our review, therefore, highlights recent advances in plant ecology that have embraced these notions, particularly at different spatial and temporal scales. Specifically, we review how isotope measurements associated with the critical plant resources carbon, water, and nitrogen have helped deepen our understanding of plant-resource acquisition, plant interactions with other organisms, and the role of plants in ecosystem studies. Where possible we also introduce how stable isotope information has provided insights into plant ecological research being done in a paleontological context. Progress in our understanding of plants in natural environments has shown that the future of plant ecological research will continue to see some of its greatest advances when stable isotope methods are applied.},

Among the mechanisms that may drive this mutualism, the most studied is provisioning of nutrients by AMF in exchange for carbon from plant hosts. However, AMF may also provide a suite of non-nutritional benefits to plants including improved water uptake, disease resistance, plant chemical defense, soil aggregation, and allelochemical transport and protection. Here, we use a meta-analysis of 93 studies to assess the relative effect of AMF on nutritional and non-nutritional factors that may influence plant fitness. We find that the positive effects of AMF on soil aggregation, water flow and disease resistance are equal to the effect of AMF on plant nitrogen and phosphorus uptake. However, AMF had no effect on the uptake of other nutrients, plant water content, allelopathic transport or production of chemical defense compounds. We suggest future research directions, including experimentally assessing the relative contribution on plant fitness of AMF interactions by untangling the independence of alternative benefits of AMF from an increase in nutrient uptake. This will lead to a more holistic view of the mycorrhizal-plant association and a more accurate picture of the net impact on the plant or plant community in question.},

This type of gene regulation, which controls diverse biological functions including virulence, is known as quorum sensing. Quorum-sensing signals, such as acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), are the essential components of the communication system. AHLs regulate virulence gene expression in a range of plant and animal (including human) bacterial pathogens. AHL-producing tobacco restored the pathogenicity of an AHL-negative mutant of Erwinia carotovora. Different bacterial species may produce different AHLs, which vary in the length and substitution of the acyl chain but contain the same homoserine lactone moiety. Here we show that the acyl-homoserine lactonase (AHL-lactonase), a new enzyme from Bacillus sp., inactivates AHL activity by hydrolysing the lactone bond of AHLs. Plants expressing AHL-lactonase quenched pathogen quorum-sensing signalling and showed significantly enhanced resistance to E. carotovora infection. Our results highlight a promising potential to use quorum-sensing signals as molecular targets for disease control, thereby broadening current approaches for prevention of bacterial infections.},

The shifting defence hypothesis (SDH) argues that invasive plant species quickly evolve towards new defence levels in the invaded area because they lack their specialist herbivores but are still under attack by local (new) generalist herbivores. The SDH predicts that plants should increase their cheap, toxic defence compounds and lower their expensive digestibility reducing compounds. As a net result resources are saved that can be allocated to growth and reproduction giving these plants a competitive edge over the local plant species. We conducted a literature study to test whether toxic defence compounds in general are increased in the invaded area and if digestibility reducing compounds are lowered. We specifically studied the levels of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, a toxin which is known for its beneficial and detrimental impact against specialists and generalists, respectively. Digestibility reducers did not show a clear trend which might be due to the small number of studies and traits measured. The meta analysis showed that toxic compounds in general and pyrrolizidine alkaloid levels specifically, increased significantly in the invaded area, supporting the predictions of the SDH that a fast evolution takes place in the allocation towards defence.},

In computational cell biology experiments, the full range of nutrient transport pathways was tested for their ability to exchange phosphorus (P)/carbon (C)/nitrogen (N) sources. As a result, we obtained a thermodynamically justified, independent and comprehensive model of the dynamics of the nutrient exchange at the plant\textendash fungus contact zone. The predicted optimal transporter network coincides with the transporter set independently confirmed in wet-laboratory experiments previously, indicating that all essential transporter types have been discovered. The thermodynamic analyses suggest that phosphate is released from the fungus via proton-coupled phosphate transporters rather than anion channels. Optimal transport pathways, such as cation channels or proton-coupled symporters, shuttle nutrients together with a positive charge across the membranes. Only in exceptional cases does electroneutral transport via diffusion facilitators appear to be plausible. The thermodynamic models presented here can be generalized and adapted to other forms of mycorrhiza and open the door for future studies combining wet-laboratory experiments with computational simulations to obtain a deeper understanding of the investigated phenomena.},

Comparisons are made with the results of the previous study in which carbohydrate was omitted. Observations suggest that the availability of an external source of carbon to the fungus upsets the balance of the symbiosis in favour of the fungal partner, even in compatible interactions, causing changes in the host cell wall and at the host-fungus interface. The rate and degree of colonization of the root surface is also influenced by the presence of carbohydrate in the synthesis medium. These results suggest that any in vitro studies undertaken on compatibility and specificity in ectomycorrhizal associations should omit carbohydrate from the medium or use an aseptically synthesized donor host as the source of fungal inoculum.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is the most wide-spread symbiotic association of plants. It involves the intracellular colonization of root cortex cells by AM fungi, a monophyletic clade of obligate symbionts known as the Glomeromycotina. AM can be found in virtually all ecological niches, and they often play an essential role in plant nutrition. In addition, AM increase stress tolerance and disease resistance of their host. In recent years, AM fungi have become increasingly recognized as tools for strategies to develop more sustainable agricultural systems. An efficient use of AM for crop production requires a detailed understanding of the processes involved in the establishment and functioning of AM. Molecular-genetic research on model systems of the last decades has tremendously advanced our understanding about mutual recognition between the symbiotic partners, and about early symbiotic signaling. In addition, the AM-associated transcriptional reprogramming of the partners has been described in considerable detail, revealing many important AM-related genes, of which many remain to be functionally characterized. One of the leading model systems in this research has been Medicago truncatula. In this chapter we summarize the current status of AM-related research in general, with particular emphasis on important contributions coming from M. truncatula.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based research through the distribution of freely available software. RESULTS Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function; however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance, COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally intensive processes. CONCLUSION COBRApy is an object-oriented framework designed to meet the computational challenges associated with the next generation of stoichiometric constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

  abstract = {SignificanceThis research uncovers the mechanisms of an ancient arms race between butterflies and plants, seen today in countless gardens as caterpillars of cabbage butterflies that devour cabbage crop varieties. Nearly 90 million years ago, the ancestors of Brassica (mustards, cabbage) and related plants developed a chemical defense called glucosinolates. While very toxic to most insects, humans experience glucosinolates as the sharp taste in wasabi, horseradish and mustard. Here we report that this triggered a chemical arms race that escalated in complexity over time. By investigating the evolutionary histories of these plants and insects, we found that major increases in chemical defense complexity were followed by butterflies evolving countertactics to allow them to continue to attack and feed on the plants. Coevolutionary interactions are thought to have spurred the evolution of key innovations and driven the diversification of much of life on Earth. However, the genetic and evolutionary basis of the innovations that facilitate such interactions remains poorly understood. We examined the coevolutionary interactions between plants (Brassicales) and butterflies (Pieridae), and uncovered evidence for an escalating evolutionary arms-race. Although gradual changes in trait complexity appear to have been facilitated by allelic turnover, key innovations are associated with gene and genome duplications. Furthermore, we show that the origins of both chemical defenses and of molecular counter adaptations were associated with shifts in diversification rates during the arms-race. These findings provide an important connection between the origins of biodiversity, coevolution, and the role of gene and genome duplications as a substrate for novel traits.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) availability is usually low in soils around the globe. Most soils have a deficiency of available P; if they are not fertilized, they will not be able to satisfy the P requirement of plants. P fertilization is generally recommended to manage soil P deficiency; however, the low efficacy of P fertilizers in acidic and in calcareous soils restricts P availability. Moreover, the overuse of P fertilizers is a cause of significant environmental concerns. However, the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), phosphate\textendash solubilizing bacteria (PSB), and the addition of silicon (Si) are effective and economical ways to improve the availability and efficacy of P. In this review the contributions of Si, PSB, and AMF in improving the P availability is discussed. Based on what is known about them, the combined strategy of using Si along with AMF and PSB may be highly useful in improving the P availability and as a result, its uptake by plants compared to using either of them alone. A better understanding how the two microorganism groups and Si interact is crucial to preserving soil fertility and improving the economic and environmental sustainability of crop production in P deficient soils. This review summarizes and discusses the current knowledge concerning the interactions among AMF, PSB, and Si in enhancing P availability and its uptake by plants in sustainable agriculture.},

Past reviews on FNPs have focused on chemical, physical or medical uses, making the extrapolation to biological applications difficult. In biology, FNPs have largely been used for biosensing and molecular tracking. However, concerns over toxicity in early types of FNPs, such as cadmium-containing quantum dots (QDs), may have prevented wide adoption. Recent developments, especially in non-Cd-containing FNPs, have alleviated toxicity problems, facilitating the use of FNPs for addressing ecological, physiological and molecule-level processes in biological research. Standardised protocols from synthesis to application and interdisciplinary approaches are critical for establishing FNPs in the biologists' tool kit. Here, we present an introduction to FNPs, summarise their use in biological applications, and discuss technical issues such as data reliability and biocompatibility. We assess whether biological research can benefit from FNPs and suggest ways in which FNPs can be applied to answer questions in biology. We conclude that FNPs have a great potential for studying various biological processes, especially tracking, sensing and imaging in physiology and ecology.},

To cope with P limitations plants have evolved strategies for enhancing P uptake and/or improving P efficiency use. The universal 450-million-yr-old arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) (fungus-root) symbioses are one of the most successful and widespread strategies to maximize access of plants to available P. AM fungi biotrophically colonize the root cortex of most plant species and develop an extraradical mycelium which overgrows the nutrient depletion zone of the soil surrounding plant roots. This hyphal network is specialized in the acquisition of low mobility nutrients from soil, particularly P. During the last years, molecular biology techniques coupled to novel physiological approaches have provided fascinating contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms of symbiotic P transport. Mycorrhiza-specific plant phosphate transporters, which are required not only for symbiotic P transfer but also for maintenance of the symbiosis, have been identified. The present review provides an overview of the contribution of AM fungi to plant P acquisition and an update of recent findings on the physiological, molecular and regulatory mechanisms of P transport in the AM symbiosis.},

  abstract = {Different symbiotic mycorrhizal associations between plants and fungi occur, almost ubiquitously, in a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. Historically, these have mainly been considered within the rather narrow perspective of their effects on the uptake of dissolved mineral nutrients by individual plants. More recent research has placed emphasis on a wider, multifunctional perspective, including the effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis on plant and microbial communities, and on ecosystem processes. This includes mobilization of N and P from organic polymers, release of nutrients from mineral particles or rock surfaces via weathering, effects on carbon cycling, interactions with myco-heterotrophic plants, mediation of plant responses to stress factors such as drought, soil acidification, toxic metals, and plant pathogens, as well as a range of possible interactions with groups of other soil micro-organisms. Mycorrhizal fungi connect their plant hosts to the heterogeneously distributed nutrients required for their growth, enabling the flow of energy-rich compounds required for nutrient mobilization whilst simultaneously providing conduits for the translocation of mobilized products back to their hosts. In addition to increasing the nutrient absorptive surface area of their host plant root systems, the extraradical mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi provides a direct pathway for translocation of photosynthetically derived carbon to microsites in the soil and a large surface area for interaction with other micro-organisms. The detailed functioning and regulation of these mycorrhizosphere processes is still poorly understood but recent progress is reviewed and potential benefits of improved understanding of mycorrhizosphere interactions are discussed.},

  abstract = {1 Soil science and ecology have developed independently, making it difficult for ecologists to contribute to urgent current debates on the destruction of the global soil resource and its key role in the global carbon cycle. Soils are believed to be exceptionally biodiverse parts of ecosystems, a view confirmed by recent data from the UK Soil Biodiversity Programme at Sourhope, Scotland, where high diversity was a characteristic of small organisms, but not of larger ones. Explaining this difference requires knowledge that we currently lack about the basic biology and biogeography of micro-organisms. 2 It seems inherently plausible that the high levels of biological diversity in soil play some part in determining the ability of soils to undertake ecosystem-level processes, such as carbon and mineral cycling. However, we lack conceptual models to address this issue, and debate about the role of biodiversity in ecosystem processes has centred around the concept of functional redundancy, and has consequently been largely semantic. More precise construction of our experimental questions is needed to advance understanding. 3 These issues are well illustrated by the fungi that form arbuscular mycorrhizas, the Glomeromycota. This ancient symbiosis of plants and fungi is responsible for phosphate uptake in most land plants, and the phylum is generally held to be species-poor and non-specific, with most members readily colonizing any plant species. Molecular techniques have shown both those assumptions to be unsafe, raising questions about what factors have promoted diversification in these fungi. One source of this genetic diversity may be functional diversity. 4 Specificity of the mycorrhizal interaction between plants and fungi would have important ecosystem consequences. One example would be in the control of invasiveness in introduced plant species: surprisingly, naturalized plant species in Britain are disproportionately from mycorrhizal families, suggesting that these fungi may play a role in assisting invasion. 5 What emerges from an attempt to relate biodiversity and ecosystem processes in soil is our extraordinary ignorance about the organisms involved. There are fundamental questions that are now answerable with new techniques and sufficient will, such as how biodiverse are natural soils? Do microbes have biogeography? Are there rare or even endangered microbes?},

  abstract = {Most flowering plants are able to form endosymbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In this mutualistic association, the fungus colonizes the root cortex and establishes elaborately branched hyphae, called arbuscules, within the cortical cells. Arbuscule development requires the cellular reorganization of both symbionts, and the resulting symbiotic interface functions in nutrient exchange. A plant symbiosis signaling pathway controls the development of the symbiosis. Several components of the pathway have been identified, but transcriptional regulators that control downstream pathways for arbuscule formation are still unknown. Here we show that DELLA proteins, which are repressors of gibberellic acid (GA) signaling and function at the nexus of several signaling pathways, are required for arbuscule formation. Arbuscule formation is severely impaired in a Medicago truncatula Mtdella1/Mtdella2 double mutant; GA treatment of wild-type roots phenocopies the della double mutant, and a dominant DELLA protein (della1-{$\Delta$}18) enables arbuscule formation in the presence of GA. Ectopic expression of della1-{$\Delta$}18 suggests that DELLA activity in the vascular tissue and endodermis is sufficient to enable arbuscule formation in the inner cortical cells. In addition, expression of della1-{$\Delta$}18 restores arbuscule formation in the symbiosis signaling pathway mutant cyclops/ipd3, indicating an intersection between DELLA and symbiosis signaling for arbuscule formation. GA signaling also influences arbuscule formation in monocots, and a Green Revolution wheat variety carrying dominant DELLA alleles shows enhanced colonization but a limited growth response to arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.},

To overcome this, several attempts have been made during the last three decades to obtain this symbiosis in vitro. The use of root-organ cultures has proved particularly successful. In this review, we describe the method by which root-organ cultures (transformed and nontransformed) have been obtained, together with the choice of host species, inoculation techniques, and culture media. We also outline the potential use of continuous cultures and cryopreservation of in vitro produced spores for long-term germ plasm storage. Furthermore, this review highlights the considerable impact that in vitro root-organ cultures have had on studies of AM fungal morphology, taxonomy, and phylogeny and how they have improved our understanding of the processes leading to root colonization and development of the extraradical mycelium. This is supported by a summary of some of the most important findings, regarding this symbiosis, that have been made at the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels. We also summarize results from studies between AM fungi and certain pathogenic and nonpathogenic soil microorganisms. We describe some of the limitations of this in vitro system and propose diverse avenues of AM research that can now be undertaken, including the potential use of a similar system for ectomycorrhizal research.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the ability of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to take up nitrogen from soil and transport it to the host plant. Maize (Zea mays L.) associated with Glomus intraradices Schenck and Smith or left uninoculated was grown in containers which were divided by a nylon net into a root compartment and a hyphal compartment. A 40 {$\mu$}m pore size nylon net was used to exclude plant roots while allowing fungal hyphae to grow into soil confined by the net. 15N tracer was supplied either as inorganic N or as organic N to the hyphal compartment at a distance of 5 cm from the net. Inoculation with the AM fungus increased the 15N content of maize compared to the non-mycorrhizal controls when N was applied as (15NH4)2SO4. However, there was no conclusive evidence that AM hyphae could derive N from organic 15N sources. Most of the increased N uptake of mycorrhizal plants occurred by hyphal translocation from the hyphal compartment to the root compartment. Higher N uptake by mycorrhizal plants with access to the hyphal compartment was indicated by depletion of total 15N in the soil of that compartment. Cutting the extraradical hyphae in the hyphal compartment in order to sever their connection with the host roots decreased the 15N uptake of the maize plants. A time-course study with inorganic 15N over 26 d showed that G. intraradices transported most of the 15N between 10 and 15 d after 15N application, whereas the non-mycorrhizal control plants had a consistently low concentration of 15N throughout the period of sampling. Nitrogen transport by external hyphae of three AM fungi, G. intraradices, Acaulospora laevis Gerdemann and Trappe and Gigaspora margarita Becker and Hall associated with maize, was further investigated. The results indicated that different isolates of AM fungi differ in the efficiency of hyphal N transport as a consequence of the different patterns of hyphal spread in the soil or of the different capacity for uptake by unit length of hyphae.},

A 40 um pore size nylon net allowed VAM hyphae to pass through the root-free zone but prevented root penetration. Replacement of this net by a 0.45 {$\mu$}m pore size membrane prevented penetration of VAM hyphae to the root-free compartment. When the berseem plants were 63 d old, the plant chambers were sealed in plastic bags to allow the roots of the plants to be exposed to a l0N2-enriched atmosphere for 5 d. Berseem plants that were exposed to a 15N2-enriched atmosphere fixed more 15N than did berseem plants maintained under air at natural 15N abundance. The total 15N excess content of berseem was similar whether or not the mycorrhiza had access to the maize roots. Plant mass (dry weight) of maize was not affected by the mycorrhizal fungus, but total nitrogen content tended to be higher in VAM-colonized maize than in non-colonized maize. Furthermore, both atom \%15N excess and 15N excess content of mycorrhizal maize were significantly increased as compared with non-mycorrhizal maize or with maize controls without berseem. The amounts of 15N transferred were small, accounting for less than 4\% of the 15N in the N2-fixing plant. In spite of the 2 cm root-free separating zone, the presence of the mycorrhizal fungus in the non-legume increased the transfer of symbiotically fixed nitrogen from berseem to maize plants that were physiologically younger. The implications of these results for nitrogen transfer from a legume to an accompanying non-legume via VAM hyphae are discussed.},

The most prominent contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to plant growth is due to uptake of nutrients by extraradical mycorrhizal hyphae. Quantification of hyphal nutrient uptake has become possible by the use of soil boxes with separated growing zones for roots and hyphae. Many (but not all) tested fungal isolates increased phosphorus and nitrogen uptake of the plant by absorbing phosphate, ammonium, and nitrate from soil. However, compared with the nutrient demand of the plant for growth, the contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to plant phosphorus uptake is usually much larger than the contribution to plant nitrogen uptake. The utilization of soil nutrients may depend more on efficient uptake of phosphate, nitrate, and ammonium from the soil solution even at low supply concentrations than on mobilization processes in the hyphosphere. In contrast to ectomycorrhizal fungi, nonsoluble nutrient sources in soil are used only to a limited extent by hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Side effects of mycorrhizal colonization on, for example, plant health or root activity may also influence plant nutrient uptake.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most vascular flowering plants have the capacity to form symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The symbiosis develops in the roots where AM fungi colonize the root cortex and form arbuscules within the cortical cells. Arbuscules are enveloped in a novel plant membrane and their establishment requires the coordinated cellular activities of both symbiotic partners. The arbuscule-cortical cell interface is the primary functional interface of the symbiosis and is of central importance in nutrient exchange. To determine the molecular events the underlie arbuscule development and function, it is first necessary to identify genes that may play a role in this process. Toward this goal we used the Affymetrix GeneChip Medicago Genome Array to document the M. truncatula transcript profiles associated with AM symbiosis, and then developed laser microdissection (LM) of M. truncatula root cortical cells to enable analyses of gene expression in individual cell types by RT-PCR.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: This approach led to the identification of novel M. truncatula and G. intraradices genes expressed in colonized cortical cells and in arbuscules. Within the arbuscule, expression of genes associated with the urea cycle, amino acid biosynthesis and cellular autophagy was detected. Analysis of gene expression in the colonized cortical cell revealed up-regulation of a lysine motif (LysM)-receptor like kinase, members of the GRAS transcription factor family and a symbiosis-specific ammonium transporter that is a likely candidate for mediating ammonium transport in the AM symbiosis.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Transcript profiling using the Affymetrix GeneChip Medicago Genome Array provided new insights into gene expression in M. truncatula roots during AM symbiosis and revealed the existence of several G. intraradices genes on the M. truncatula GeneChip. A laser microdissection protocol that incorporates low-melting temperature Steedman's wax, was developed to enable laser microdissection of M. truncatula root cortical cells. LM coupled with RT-PCR provided spatial gene expression information for both symbionts and expanded current information available for gene expression in cortical cells containing arbuscules.},

Much like social networks or neural networks, the fungal mycelia of mycorrhizas allow signals to be sent between trees in a forest. These mycorrhizal networks are effectively an information highway, with recent studies demonstrating the exchange of nutritional resources, defence signals and allelochemicals. Sensing and responding to networked signals elicits complex behavioural responses in plants. This ability to communicate ('tree talk') is a foundational process in forest ecosystems., Adaptive behaviour of plants, including rapid changes in physiology, gene regulation and defence response, can be altered when linked to neighbouring plants by a mycorrhizal network (MN).

This exchange is a significant factor in global nutrient cycles as well as in the ecology, evolution and physiology of plants. Despite its importance as a nutrient, very little is known about how AMF take up nitrogen and transfer it to their host plants. Here we report the results of stable isotope labelling experiments showing that inorganic nitrogen taken up by the fungus outside the roots is incorporated into amino acids, translocated from the extraradical to the intraradical mycelium as arginine, but transferred to the plant without carbon. Consistent with this mechanism, the genes of primary nitrogen assimilation are preferentially expressed in the extraradical tissues, whereas genes associated with arginine breakdown are more highly expressed in the intraradical mycelium. Strong changes in the expression of these genes in response to nitrogen availability and form also support the operation of this novel metabolic pathway in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.},

On a whole-plant scale, changing source and sink relations accompanying plant development add another level of complexity to metabolism. With the aim of achieving a spatiotemporal resolution of source-sink interactions in crop plant metabolism, a multiscale metabolic modeling (MMM) approach was applied that integrates static organ-specific models with a whole-plant dynamic model. Allowing for a dynamic flux balance analysis on a whole-plant scale, the MMM approach was used to decipher the metabolic behavior of source and sink organs during the generative phase of the barley (Hordeum vulgare) plant. It reveals a sink-to-source shift of the barley stem caused by the senescence-related decrease in leaf source capacity, which is not sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of sink organs such as the growing seed. The MMM platform represents a novel approach for the in silico analysis of metabolism on a whole-plant level, allowing for a systemic, spatiotemporally resolved understanding of metabolic processes involved in carbon partitioning, thus providing a novel tool for studying yield stability and crop improvement.},

QS signaling requires the synthesis, exchange and perception of bacterial compounds, called autoinducers or QS signals (e.g. N-acylhomoserine lactones). The disruption of QS signaling, also termed quorum quenching (QQ), encompasses very diverse phenomena and mechanisms which are presented and discussed in this review. First, we surveyed the QS-signal diversity and QS-associated responses for a better understanding of the targets of the QQ phenomena that organisms have naturally evolved and are currently actively investigated in applied perspectives. Next the mechanisms, targets and molecular actors associated with QS interference are presented, with a special emphasis on the description of natural QQ enzymes and chemicals acting as QS inhibitors. Selected QQ paradigms are detailed to exemplify the mechanisms and biological roles of QS inhibition in microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. Finally, some QQ strategies are presented as promising tools in different fields such as medicine, aquaculture, crop production and anti-biofouling area.},

In addition, algae have to cope with a limited supply of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis because of the absence of a bicarbonate pool. Therefore, some algae grow mainly in near terrestrial situations to increase the CO2-availability or actively move within the water body into areas with high CO2. Beside these direct effects of acidity, high concentrations of heavy metals and precipitation of nutrients cause indirect effects on the algae in many acidic environments.},

Dual compartment microcosms, where AMF (Glomus mosseae) were either allowed access (AM+) to or excluded (AM-) from forest soil compartments containing litterbags (leaf litter from Calophyllum polyanthum) were used. The experiment ran for six months, with destructive harvests at 0, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days. For each harvest we measured AMF colonization, soil nutrients, litter mass loss, and microbial biomass (using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA)). AMF significantly enhanced litter decomposition in the first 5 months, whilst delaying the development of total microbial biomass (represented by total PLFA) from T150 to T180. A significant decline in soil available N was observed through the course of the experiment for both treatments. This study shows that AMF have the capacity to interact with soil microbial communities and inhibit the development of fungal and bacterial groups in the soil at the later stage of the litter decomposition (180 days), whilst enhancing the rates of decomposition.},

Here, we show that the fungus accumulates nutrients when connected to a host that is of less benefit to the fungus, indicating a potential of the fungus to control the transfer of nutrients. We used a monoxenic in vitro model of root organ cultures associated with Glomus intraradices, in which we manipulated the C availability to the plant. We found that G. intraradices accumulated up to seven times more nutrients in its spores, and up to nine times more in its hyphae, when the C pool available to the associated roots was halved. The strongest effect was found for phosphorus (P), considered to be the most important nutrient in the AM symbiosis. Other elements such as potassium and chorine were also accumulated, but to a lesser extent, while no accumulation of iron or manganese was found. Our results suggest a functional linkage between C and P exchange.},

Then, adaptive evolution and coevolution were analyzed. The phylogenetic tree showed that the inner groups were clustered into four branches, in which the sequences of Galdieria maxima were divided into two small branches, and the posterior probability of each branch is above 94.9\%. Eleven reliable positive selection sites were detected in the branched-site model, indicating that the rbcL protein-coding gene of Galdieria underwent adaptive evolution to adapt to extreme environments. Site 269 F is located in the loop 6 domain, while sites 272 D and 273 W are located in the 6-helix structure.

  abstract = {Nitrogen stable isotope (N-15, N-14) natural abundance has been much less used than carbon isotopes (C-13, C-12) in plant physiology and ecology. Analytical problems, the lower fractional abundance of N-15 than of C-13 in the biosphere, the greater complexity of the N cycle relative to the C cycle, and smaller expressed discriminations in nature, are contributing factors. The major N pools, globally, have different isotope signatures: atmospheric N2 is N-15-depleted relative to organic N (including sedimentary N), a situation resulting from a greater expressed discrimination in the organic N to N2 (via denitrification) reaction than of diazotrophy during accumulation of the reduced N. Essentially all of the enzymes except nitrogenase which transform N compounds show discrimination against N-15, although for glutamine synthetase, and the amination of 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate, this is only seen in terms of NH+4 rather than the true substrate, NH3.

Analytical problems, the lower fractional abundance of 15N than of 13C in the biosphere, the greater complexity of the N cycle relative to the C cycle, and smaller expressed discriminations in nature, are contributing factors. The major N pools, globally, have different isotope signatures: atmospheric N2 is 15N-depleted relative to organic N (including sedimentary N), a situation resulting from a greater expressed discrimination in the organic N to N2 (via denitrification) reaction than of diazotrophy during accumulation of the reduced N. Essentially all of the enzymes except nitrogenase which transform N compounds show discrimination against 15N, although for glutamine synthetase, and the amination of 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate, this is only seen in terms of NH4+ rather than the true substrate, NH3.

Studies of the interaction of endophytes with their host plants and their function within their hosts are important to address the ecological relevance of endophytes. The modulation of ethylene levels in plants by bacterially produced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase is a key trait that enables interference with the physiology of the host plant. Endophytes with this capacity might profit from association with the plant, because colonization is enhanced. In turn, host plants benefit by stress reduction and increased root growth. This mechanism leads to the concept of `competent' endophytes, defined as endophytes that are equipped with genes important for maintenance of plant\textendash endophyte associations. The ecological role of these endophytes and their relevance for plant growth are discussed here.},

  abstract = {AbstractMany microorganisms form symbioses with plants that range, on a continuous scale, from parasitic to mutualistic. Among these, the most widespread mutualistic symbiosis is the arbuscular mycorrhiza, formed between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and vascular flowering plants. These associations occur in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world and have a global impact on plant phosphorus nutrition. The arbuscular mycorrhiza is an endosymbiosis in which the fungus inhabits the root cortical cells and obtains carbon provided by the plant while it transfers mineral nutrients from the soil to the cortical cells. Development of the symbiosis involves the differentiation of both symbionts to create novel symbiotic interfaces within the root cells. The aim of this review is to explore the current understanding of the signals and signaling pathways used by the symbionts for the development of the AM symbiosis. Although the signal molecules used for initial communication are not yet known, recent studies point to their existence. Within the plant, there is evidence of arbuscular mycorrhiza-specific signals and of systemic signaling that influences phosphate-starvation responses and root development. The landmark cloning of three plant signaling proteins required for the development of the symbiosis has provided the first insights into a signaling pathway that is used by AM fungi and by rhizobia for their symbiotic associations with legumes.},

Severe plant N deficiency reduced the percentage root length colonised (but not the percentage viable colonisation), hyphal length, total N uptake by hyphae and dry weight of mycorrhizal plants.

Of the 15N supplied to hyphae in pot cultures over 48 h, 0.2 and 6\% was transported to plants supplied with insufficient N or sufficient N, respectively. The increased 15N uptake at the higher N supply was related to the higher hyphal length density at the higher N supply. These findings were supported by results from in vitro and monoxenic studies. Excised hyphae from four Glomus isolates (BEG 84, 107, 108 and 110) acquired N from both inorganic (15NH415NO3, 15NO3- or 15NH4+) and organic (15N-Gly and 15N-Glu, except in BEG 84 where amino acid uptake was not tested) sources in vitro during short-term experiments. Confirming these studies under sterile conditions where no bacterial mineralisation of organic N occurred, monoxenic cultures of Glomus intraradices Schenk and Smith were shown to transport N from organic sources (15N-Gly and 15N-Glu) to Ri T-DNA transformed, AM-colonised carrot roots in a long-term experiment. The higher N uptake (also from organic N) by isolates from nutrient poor sites (BEG 108 and 110) compared to that from a conventional agricultural field implied that ecotypic differences occur. Although the arbuscular mycorrhizal isolates used contributed to the acquisition of N from both inorganic and organic sources by the host plants/roots used, this was not enough to increase the N nutritional status of the mycorrhizal compared to non-mycorrhizal hosts.},

Arbuscular mycor - rhizae (AM) and ectomycorrhizae (EM) are the most important mycorrhizae in agricultural and natural ecosystems. AM and EM fungi use inorganic NH + 4 and NO - 3 , and most EM fungi are capable of using organic nitrogen. The heavier stable isotope 15 N is discriminated against during biogeochemical and biochemical processes. Differences in 15 N (atom\%) or {$\delta$} 15 N (\textperthousand ) provide nitrogen movement information in an experimental system. A range of 20 to 50\% of one - way N - transfer has been observed from legumes to nonlegumes. Mycorrhizal fungal mycelia can extend from one plant ' s roots to another plant ' s roots to form common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Individual species , genera , even families of plants can be interconnected by CMNs. They are capable of facilitating nutrient uptake and flux. Nutrients such as carbon , nitrogen and phosphorus and other elements may then move via either AM or EM networks from plant to plant. Both 15 N labeling and 15 N natural abundance techniques have been employed to trace N movement between plants interconnected by AM or EM networks. Fine mesh (25{$\sim$}45 \textmu m) has been used to separate root systems and allow only hyphal penetration and linkages but no root contact between plants. In many studies , nitrogen from N 2 - fixing mycorrhizal plants transferred to non - N 2 \textendash{} fixing mycorrhizal plants (one - way N - transfer). In a few studies , N is also transferred from non - N 2 \textendash{} fixing mycorrhizal plants to N 2 - fixing mycorrhizal plants (two - way N - transfer). There is controversy about whether N - transfer is direct through CMNs , or indirect through the soil. The lack of convincing data underlines the need for creative , careful experimental manipulations. Nitrogen is crucial to productivity in most terrestrial ecosystems , and there are potential benefits of management in soil - plant systems to enhance N - transfer. Thus , two - way N - transfer warrants further investigation with many species and under field conditions.},

  abstract = {Darwin's model of evolution by natural selection was based on his observations of change in discrete organisms in which individuals are easy to define. Many of the most abundant functional groups in ecosystems, such as fungi and bacteria, do not fit this paradigm. In this review, we seek to understand how the elegant logic of Darwinian natural selection can be applied to distributed clonal organisms. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are one such group. Globally, they are ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems, are locally distributed among many host plant species, and are significant drivers of nutrient cycling in ecosystems. The AM fungi are intractable to study, as the few taxa that can be cultured cannot be grown in the absence of plant roots. Research has focused on the plant\textendash fungus interface, and thus on the symbiotic phenotype. A model is discussed for the interchange of materials at the interface that throws the emphasis of research onto the behaviour of the individual organisms and removes the need to test for phenomena such as selectivity, co-evolution, and cheating. The AM fungi are distributed organisms with an extensive external mycelium that is likely to be under strong environmental selection. AM fungi show sufficient phenotypic variation and fitness differentials for selection to occur, and developments in genetic analyses suggest that a better understanding of heritability in these organisms is not far away. It is argued that direct selection on fungal traits related to their survival and performance in the soil independent of the host is likely to be the major driver of differentiation in the AM fungi, and the evidence for direct fungal responses to soil conditions such as pH, hypoxia, and temperature is reviewed.},

  abstract = {Mycorrhizae play a critical role in nutrient capture from soils. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and ectomycorrhizae (EM) are the most important mycorrhizae in agricultural and natural ecosystems. AM and EM fungi use inorganic NH4 + and NO3 -, and most EM fungi are capable of using organic nitrogen. The heavier stable isotope 15N is discriminated against during biogeochemical and biochemical processes. Differences in 15N (atom\%) or {$\delta$}15N (\textperthousand ) provide nitrogen movement information in an experimental system. A range of 20 to 50\% of one-way N-transfer has been observed from legumes to nonlegumes. Mycorrhizal fungal mycelia can extend from one plant's roots to another plant's roots to form common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Individual species, genera, even families of plants can be interconnected by CMNs. They are capable of facilitating nutrient uptake and flux. Nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and other elements may then move via either AM or EM networks from plant to plant. Both 15N labeling and 15N natural abundance techniques have been employed to trace N movement between plants interconnected by AM or EM networks. Fine mesh (25{$\sim$}45 {$\mu$}m) has been used to separate root systems and allow only hyphal penetration and linkages but no root contact between plants. In many studies, nitrogen from N2-fixing mycorrhizal plants transferred to non-N2\textendash fixing mycorrhizal plants (one-way N-transfer). In a few studies, N is also transferred from non-N2\textendash fixing mycorrhizal plants to N2-fixing mycorrhizal plants (two-way N-transfer). There is controversy about whether N-transfer is direct through CMNs, or indirect through the soil. The lack of convincing data underlines the need for creative, careful experimental manipulations. Nitrogen is crucial to productivity in most terrestrial ecosystems, and there are potential benefits of management in soil-plant systems to enhance N-transfer. Thus, two-way N-transfer warrants further investigation with many species and under field conditions.},

This study recorded a yield of 0.63g biomass/g glucose under mixotrophic conditions while that under heterotrophic conditions was 0.42g biomass/g glucose. These laboratory studies were extended to cultivate G. sulphuraria under field conditions in a 700L photobioreactor (PBR) fed with primary-settled wastewater. Biomass growth and removal of dissolved organic carbon and nutrients in this PBR under batch mode were monitored over a range of influent and operating conditions. This field study confirmed that G. sulphuraria was able to grow well in primary-settled wastewater and reduce organic carbon (measured as BOD5), ammoniacal nitrogen, and phosphate levels to below the respective discharge standards; corresponding 3-day removal efficiencies ranged 46\textendash 72\%; 63\textendash 89\%; and 71\textendash 95\%.},

  abstract = {Steady-state and dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) was used to investigate the effects of metabolic model complexity and parameters on ethanol production predictions for wild-type and engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three metabolic network models ranging from a single compartment representation of metabolism to a genome-scale reconstruction with seven compartments and detailed charge balancing were studied. Steady-state analysis showed that the models generated similar wild-type predictions for the biomass and ethanol yields, but for ten engineered strains the seven compartment model produced smaller ethanol yield enhancements. Simplification of the seven compartment model to two intracellular compartments produced increased ethanol yields, suggesting that reaction localisation had an impact on mutant phenotype predictions. Further analysis with the seven compartment model demonstrated that steady-state predictions can be sensitive to intracellular model parameters, with the biomass yield exhibiting high sensitivity to ATP utilisation parameters and the biomass composition. The incorporation of gene expression data through the zeroing of metabolic reactions associated with unexpressed genes was shown to produce negligible changes in steady-state predictions when the oxygen uptake rate was suitably constrained. Dynamic extensions of the single and seven compartment models were developed through the addition of glucose and oxygen uptake expressions and transient extracellular balances. While the dynamic models produced similar predictions of the optimal batch ethanol productivity for the wild type, the single compartment model produced significantly different predictions for four implementable gene insertions. A combined deletion/overexpression/ insertion mutant with improved ethanol productivity capabilities was computationally identified by dynamically screening multiple combinations of the ten metabolic engineering strategies. The authors concluded that extensive compartmentalisation and detailed charge balancing can be important for reliably screening metabolic engineering strategies that rely on modification of the global redox balance and that DFBA offers the potential to identify novel mutants for enhanced metabolite production in batch and fed-batch cultures. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

  abstract = {When roots encounter a nutrient-rich zone or patch they often proliferate within it. Roots experiencing nutrient-rich patches can also enhance their physiological ion-uptake capacities compared with roots of the same plant outside the patch zone. These plastic responses by the root system have been proposed as the major mechanism by which plants cope with the naturally occurring heterogeneous supplies of nutrients in soil. Various attempts to predict how contrasting species will respond to patches have been made based on specific root length (SRL), root demography and biomass allocation within the patch zone. No one criterion has proved definitive. Actually demonstrating that root proliferation is beneficial to the plant, especially in terms of nitrogen capture from patches, has also proved troublesome. Yet by growing plants under more realistic conditions, such as in interspecific plant competition, and with a complex organic patch, a direct benefit can be demonstrated. Thus, as highlighted in this review, the environmental context in which the root response is expressed is as important as the magnitude of the response itself. Contents I. Introduction 9 II.

This highly dynamic form of immunity is initiated by the recognition of insect oral secretions and signals from injured plant cells. These initial cues are transmitted within the plant by signal transduction pathways that include calcium ion fluxes, phosphorylation cascades, and, in particular, the jasmonate pathway, which plays a central and conserved role in promoting resistance to a broad spectrum of insects.

  abstract = {Cyanidioschyzon merolae is a unicellular red alga living in acid hot springs, which is able to grow on ammonium, as well as nitrate as sole nitrogen source. Based on the complete genome sequence, proteins for nitrate utilization, nitrate transporter (NRT) and nitrate reductase (NR), were predicted to be encoded by the neighboring nuclear genes CMG018C and CMG019C, respectively, but no typical nitrite reductase (NiR) gene was found by similarity searches. On the other hand, two candidate genes for sulfite reductase (SiR) were found, one of which (CMG021C) is located next to the above-noted nitrate-related genes. Given that transcripts of CMG018C, CMG019C and CMG021C accumulate in nitrate-containing media, but are repressed by ammonium, and that SiR and NiR are structurally related enzymes, we hypothesized that the CMG021C gene product functions as an NiR in C. merolae. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method for targeted gene disruption in C. merolae. In support of our hypothesis, we found that a CMG021G null mutant in comparison with the parental strain showed decreased cell growth in nitrate-containing but not in ammonium-containing media. Furthermore, expression of CMG021C in the nirA mutant of a cyanobacterium, Leptolyngbya boryana (formerly Plectonema boryanum), could genetically complement the NiR defect. Immunofluorescent analysis indicated the localization of CMG021C in chloroplasts, and hence we propose an overall scheme for nitrate assimilation in C. merolae.},

Methods and Results Using Solanum lycopersicum and Medicago polymorpha leaves pre- and post-herbivory, we demonstrate that our protocol quantifies common plant defense responses: peroxidase production, polyphenol oxidase production, reactive oxygen species production, total protein production, and trypsin-like protease inhibition activity. Conclusions Current protocols can require 500 mg of tissue, but our assays detect activity in less than 10 mg. Our protocol takes two people 6 h to run any of the assays on 300 samples in triplicate, or all of the assays on 20 samples. Our protocol enables researchers to plan complex experiments that compare local versus systemic plant responses, quantify environmental and genetic variation, and measure population-level variation.},

It was tested whether multispecies mixtures provided more phosphorus and supported greater plant growth than single AMF species. ??Two host plants, medic (Medicago truncatula) and leek (Allium porrum), were inoculated with three AMF species (Glomus mosseae, G. claroideum and G. intraradices), either separately or in mixtures. The composition of the AMF communities in the roots was assessed using real-time PCR to determine the copy number of large ribosomal subunit genes. ??Fungal communities in the roots were usually dominated by one AMF species (G. mosseae). The composition of the communities depended on both plant identity and the time of harvest. Leek colonized by a mixture of G. claroideum and G. intraradices acquired more P than with either of the two AMF separately. ??Direct evidence is provided for functional complementarity among species within the AMF community colonizing a single root system. Competition among the species poses a major challenge in interpreting experiments with mixed inoculations, but this is greatly facilitated by use of real-time PCR.},

This widespread coexistence of plants and fungi has important consequences for plant mineral nutrition, water acquisition, carbon allocation, tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses and interplant competition. Yet some current research indicates a number of important roles to be played by hyphae-associated microbes, in addition to the hyphae themselves, in foraging for and acquisition of soil resources and in transformation of organic carbon in the soil-plant systems. We critically review the available scientific evidence for the theory that the surface of mycorrhizal hyphae in soil is colonized by highly specialized microbial communities, and that these fulfill important functions in the ecology of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae such as accessing recalcitrant forms of mineral nutrients, and production of signaling and other compounds in the vicinity of the hyphae. The validity of another hypothesis will then be addressed, namely that the specific associative microbes are rewarded with exclusive access to fungal carbon, which would qualify them as hypersymbionts (i.e., symbionts of symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi). Thereafter, we ask whether recruitment of functionally different microbial assemblages by the hyphae is required under different soil conditions (questioning what evidence is available for such an effect), and we identify knowledge gaps requiring further attention.},

Experiments on the relationship between the host plant and AM in soil or in sterile root-organ culture have provided clear evidence that the extraradical mycelia of AM fungi uptake various forms of nitrogen (N) and transport the assimilated N to the roots of the host plant. However, the uptake mechanisms of various forms of N and its translocation and transfer from the fungus to the host are virtually unknown. Therefore, there is a dearth of integrated models describing the movement of N through the AM fungal hyphae. Recent studies examined Ri T-DNA-transformed carrot roots colonized with AM fungi in 15N tracer experiments. In these experiments, the activities of key enzymes were determined, and expressions of genes related to N assimilation and translocation pathways were quantified. This review summarizes and discusses the results of recent research on the forms of N uptake, transport, degradation, and transfer to the roots of the host plant and the underlying mechanisms, as well as research on the forms of N and carbon used by germinating spores and their effects on amino acid metabolism. Finally, a pathway model summarizing the entire mechanism of N metabolism in AM fungi is outlined.},

The plants were grown together in PVC containers, either in symbiosis with Glomus intraradices Schenck and Smith or as non-mycorrhizal controls, and with their root systems separated by an intermediate buffer zone (2 cm), confined by fine nylon mesh. The pea donor plants were supplied simultaneously with 15N and 32P, using a split-root labelling technique, in order to follow the flow of N and P to the barley receiver plants during 60 d of growth. In half of the containers, the donor-plant shoot was removed 42 d after the start of labelling and the roots were left in the soil to decompose. The reverse transfer of N and P, from barley donor to pea receiver plants was also measured to allow calculation of the net transfer through hyphae between mycorrhizal donor and receiver plants. No significant transfer of N was detected from intact pea donor plants to the barley receiver plants in the non-mycorrhizal controls. Mycorrhizal colonization slightly increased the transfer of N. However, the net transfer of N was almost insignificant since N was also transferred in the reverse direction, from barley to pea. Removal of the pea donor-plant shoots increased the N transfer to 4\% of the donor-root N in the non-mycorrhizal controls. Contrastingly, 15\% of the donor-root N was transferred to the receiver plants, when plants were colonized by G. intraradices. The results for P transfer followed the same patterns as was observed for N, although in smaller proportions. The results indicate that arbuscular mycorrhizas may play a significant role in the flow of N and P between two plants interconnected by hyphae, when the root system of one of the plants is decomposing.},

In natural habitats, and in an ecologically meaningful time span, these associations have evolved to improve the fitness of both plant and fungal symbionts. In systems managed by humans, mycorrhizal associations often improve plant productivity, but this is not always the case. Mycorrhizal fungi might be considered to be parasitic on plants when net cost of the symbiosis exceeds net benefits. Parasitism can be developmentally induced, environmentally induced, or possibly genotypically induced. Morphological, phenological, and physiological characteristics of the symbionts influence the functioning of mycorrhizas at an individual scale. Biotic and abiotic factors at the rhizosphere, community, and ecosystem scales further mediate mycorrhizal functioning. Despite the complexity of mycorrhizal associations, it might be possible to construct predictive models of mycorrhizal functioning. These models will need to incorporate variables and parameters that account for differences in plant responses to, and control of, mycorrhizal fungi, and differences in fungal effects on, and responses to, the plant. Developing and testing quantitative models of mycorrhizal functioning in the real world requires creative experimental manipulations and measurements. This work will be facilitated by recent advances in molecular and biochemical techniques. A greater understanding of how mycorrhizas function in complex natural systems is a prerequisite to managing them in agriculture, forestry, and restoration.},

We present a mathematical model describing a previously overlooked process: nitrogen isotope fractionation during leaf-atmosphere NH3(g) exchange. The model predicts that when leaf-atmosphere exchange of NH3(g) occurs in a closed system, the atmospheric reservoir of NH3(g) equilibrates at a concentration equal to the ammonia compensation point and an isotopic composition 8.1\textperthousand{} lighter than nitrogen in protein. In an open system, when atmospheric concentrations of NH3(g) fall below or rise above the compensation point, protein can be isotopically enriched by net efflux of NH3(g) or depleted by net uptake. Comparison of model output with existing measurements in the literature suggests that this process contributes to variation in the isotopic composition of nitrogen in plants as well as NH3(g) in the atmosphere, and should be considered in future analyses of nitrogen isotope circulation. The matrix-based modelling approach that is introduced may be useful for quantifying isotope dynamics in other complex systems that can be described by first-order kinetics.},

Among these symbioses, arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal associations can be found in a large proportion of plants, including many crops. Split-root assays are widely used in plant research to study local and systemic signaling responses triggered by local treatments, including nutrient availability, interaction with soil microbes, or abiotic stresses. However, split-root approaches have only been occasionally used to tackle these questions with regard to mycorrhizal symbioses. This review compiles and discusses split-root assays developed to study arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal symbioses, with a particular emphasis on colonization by multiple beneficial symbionts, systemic resistance induced by mycorrhizal fungi, water and nutrient transport from fungi to colonized plants, and host photosynthate allocation from the host to fungal symbionts.

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi associate with the vast majority of land plants, providing mutual nutritional benefits and protecting hosts against biotic and abiotic stresses. Significant progress was made recently in our understanding of the genomic organization, the obligate requirements, and the sexual nature of these fungi through the release and subsequent mining of genome sequences. Genomic and genetic approaches also improved our understanding of the signal repertoire used by AM fungi and their plant hosts to recognize each other for the initiation and maintenance of this association. Evolutionary and bioinformatic analyses of host and nonhost plant genomes represent novel ways with which to decipher host mechanisms controlling these associations and shed light on the stepwise acquisition of this genetic toolkit during plant evolution. Mining fungal and plant genomes along with evolutionary and genetic approaches will improve understanding of these symbiotic associations and, in the long term, their usefulness in agricultural settings.

  abstract = {Rhizobial and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses each may consume 4-16\% of recently photosynthetically-fixed carbon to maintain their growth, activity and reserves. Rhizobia and AM fungi improve plant photosynthesis through N and P acquisition, but increased nutrient uptake by these symbionts does not fully explain observed increases in the rate of photosynthesis of symbiotic plants. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that carbon sink strength of rhizobial and AM symbioses stimulates the rates of photosynthesis. Nutrient-independent effects of rhizobial and AM symbioses result in direct compensation of C costs at the source. We calculated the response ratios of photosynthesis and nutrient mass fraction in the leaves of legumes inoculated with rhizobial and/or AM fungi relative to non-inoculated plants in a number of published studies. On average, photosynthetic rates were significantly increased by 28 and 14\% due to rhizobial and AM symbioses, respectively, and 51\% due to dual symbiosis. The leaf P mass fraction was increased significantly by 13\% due to rhizobial symbioses. Although the increases were not significant, AM symbioses increased leaf P mass fraction by 6\% and dual symbioses by 41\%. The leaf N mass fraction was not significantly affected by any of the rhizobial, AM and dual symbioses. The rate of photosynthesis increased substantially more than the C costs of the rhizobial and AM symbioses. The inoculation of legumes with rhizobia and/or AM fungi, which resulted in sink stimulation of photosynthesis, improved the photosynthetic nutrient use efficiency and the proportion of seed yield in relation to the total plant biomass (harvest index). Sink stimulation represent an adaptation mechanism that allows legumes to take advantage of nutrient supply from their microsymbionts without compromising the total amount of photosynthates available for plant growth. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Since legumes spend up to 4-16\% of photosynthesis on each of the rhizobial and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal symbioses, it might be expected that positive responses in yield due to rhizobial and AM symbioses are accompanied by decreases in seed protein and lipid mass fractions due to a photosynthate (C) limitation. We performed a meta-analysis of 348 data points from published studies with 12 legume species to test whether yield, harvest index, and seed protein and lipid mass fractions are affected by symbioses. There was a significant increase in yield due to rhizobial inoculation (16\% in the field; 59\% in pot experiments). There were no responses of yield to AM fungi and rhizobial + AM fungi inoculations in the field (presumably because an AM fungi-free control cannot be ensured), but significant responses in pots (45\% with AM fungi; 44\% with rhizobial + AM fungi). Rhizobial inoculation improved seed protein mass fraction by 7\% in the field; AM fungi increased this parameter by 14\% in pots. There were no discernable effects of symbioses on seed lipid mass fraction. Rhizobial symbioses in the field increased harvest index (+5\%), but AM fungi did not affect harvest index. In conclusion, increases in yield due to symbioses also resulted in increases in seed protein and constant lipid mass fractions, indicating that legumes are not C-limited under symbiotic conditions. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The 450-million-year-old symbiosis between the majority of land plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is one of the most ancient, abundant, and ecologically important mutualisms on Earth. Yet, the evolutionary stability of mycorrhizal associations is still poorly understood, as it follows none of the constraints thought to stabilize cooperation in other well-known mutualisms. The capacity of both host and symbiont to simultaneously interact with several partners introduces a unique dilemma; detecting and punishing those exploiting the mutualism becomes increasingly difficult if these individuals can continue to access resources from alternative sources. Here, we explore four hypotheses to explain evolutionary cooperation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis: (1) pseudo-vertical transmission and spatial structuring of plant and fungal populations leading to local adaptation of partners; (2) luxury resource exchange in which plants trade surplus carbon for excess fungal nutrients; (3) partner choice allowing partners to associate with better cooperators; and (4) host and symbiont sanctions which actively reward good partners and punish less cooperative ones. We propose that mycorrhizal cooperation is promoted by an exchange of surplus resources between partners and enforced through sanctions by one or both partners. These mechanisms may allow plant and fungal genotypes to discriminate against individuals employing exploitative strategies, promoting patterns of partner choice. Together these selection pressures provide a framework for understanding the stabilization of mycorrhizal cooperation over evolutionary time.},

This increases the potential for exploitation and defection by individuals, raising the question of how partners maintain a fair, two-way transfer of resources. We manipulated cooperation in plants and fungal partners to show that plants can detect, discriminate, and reward the best fungal partners with more carbohydrates. In turn, their fungal partners enforce cooperation by increasing nutrient transfer only to those roots providing more carbohydrates. On the basis of these observations we conclude that, unlike many other mutualisms, the symbiont cannot be ``enslaved.'' Rather, the mutualism is evolutionarily stable because control is bidirectional, and partners offering the best rate of exchange are rewarded.},

Glutamate, aspartate, histidine, or proline, when provided as the sole source of nitrogen, induced swarming, while arginine, asparagine, and glutamine, among other amino acids, did not sustain swarming. Cells from the edge of the swarm were about twice as long as cells from the swarm center. In both instances, bacteria possessing two polar flagella were observed by light and electron microscopy. While a fliC mutant of P. aeruginosa displayed slightly diminished swarming, a pilR and a pilA mutant, both deficient in type IV pili, were unable to swarm. Furthermore, cells with mutations in the las cell-to-cell signaling system showed diminished swarming behavior, while rhl mutants were completely unable to swarm. Evidence is presented for rhamnolipids being the actual surfactant involved in swarming motility, which explains the involvement of the cell-to-cell signaling circuitry of P. aeruginosa in this type of surface motility.},

This AM factor elicits expression of the Nod factor-inducible gene MtENOD11, visualized using a pMtENOD11-gusA reporter. Transgene induction occurs primarily in the root cortex, with expression stretching from the zone of root hair emergence to the region of mature root hairs. All AM fungi tested (Gigaspora rosea,Gigaspora gigantea, Gigaspora margarita, and Glomus intraradices) elicit a similar response, whereas pathogenic fungi such as Phythophthora medicaginis, Phoma medicaginis var pinodella andFusarium solani f.sp. phaseoli do not, suggesting that the observed root response is specific to AM fungi. Finally, pMtENOD11-gusA induction in response to the diffusible AM fungal factor is also observed with all threeM. truncatulaNod-/Myc- mutants (dmi1,dmi2, and dmi3), whereas the same mutants are blocked in their response to Nod factor. This positive response of the Nod-/Myc- mutants to the diffusible AM fungal factor and the different cellular localization of pMtENOD11-gusA expression in response to Nod factor versus AM factor suggest that signal transduction occurs via different pathways and that expression of MtENOD11 is differently regulated by the two diffusible factors.},

However, this approach requires a better understanding of how plants and AMF intimately interact with each other in saline environments and how this interaction leads to physiological changes in plants. This knowledge is important to develop sustainable strategies for successful utilization of AMF to improve plant health under a variety of stress conditions. Recent advances in the field of molecular biology, ``omics'' technology and advanced microscopy can provide new insight about these mechanisms of interaction between AMF and plants, as well as other microbes.

Traditional theories about the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in plant nutrition have emphasized quantitative effects on uptake and transport of dissolved nutrients. Qualitative effects of the symbiosis on the ability of plants to access organic nitrogen and phosphorus sources have also become increasingly apparent. Recent research suggests that ectomycorrhizal fungi mobilize other essential plant nutrients directly from minerals through excretion of organic acids. This enables ectomycorrhizal plants to utilize essential nutrients from insoluble mineral sources and affects nutrient cycling in forest systems.},

Such insights complement our more advanced knowledge of the host plant response to AM fungi, from signal transduction to cell reorganization, metabolic and physiological reprogramming, and systemic responses. Lastly, we comment on our current understanding of natural variation in AM interactions, exploring the reciprocal advantages and disadvantages that emerge when coupling different fungal isolates and wild or domesticated plant varieties.},

Perspectives 1039 Acknowledgements 1041 References 1041 Summary The evolutionary and ecological success of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis relies on an efficient and multifactorial communication system for partner recognition, and on a fine-tuned and reciprocal metabolic regulation of each symbiont to reach an optimal functional integration. Besides strigolactones, N-acetylglucosamine-derivatives released by the plant were recently suggested to trigger fungal reprogramming at the pre-contact stage. Remarkably, N-acetylglucosamine-based diffusible molecules also are symbiotic signals produced by AM fungi (AMF) and clues on the mechanisms of their perception by the plant are emerging. AMF genomes and transcriptomes contain a battery of putative effector genes that may have conserved and AMF- or host plant-specific functions. Nutrient exchange is the key feature of AM symbiosis. A mechanism of phosphate transport inside fungal hyphae has been suggested, and first insights into the regulatory mechanisms of root colonization in accordance with nutrient transfer and status were obtained. The recent discovery of the dependency of AMF on fatty acid transfer from the host has offered a convincing explanation for their obligate biotrophism. Novel studies highlighted the importance of plant and fungal genotypes for the outcome of the symbiosis. These findings open new perspectives for fundamental research and application of AMF in agriculture.},

Their great potential in bioproduction and bioremediation has barely been exploited, particularly for the well-characterized red algae Galdieria sulphuraria and Cyanidioschyzon merolae. These and other Cyanidiales are excellent candidates for biotechnological enhancement and metabolic engineering for a broad spectrum of applications including the production of biofuels and thermostable colourants. In particular, extremophily, such as growth at thermophilic temperatures \textendash{} up to 60\textdegree C \textendash{} and at low pH and high salinity, make these algae unusually resistant to contamination and pathogens, and therefore potentially more commercially viable. We review existing applications of the Cyanidiales, as well as their available molecular tools. Their varied nutritional demands, from the broad heterotrophy of G. sulphuraria to strongly autotrophic C. merolae, along with their ability to grow to high densities, confer great potential as expression hosts. We also discuss the deficiencies that must be overcome to unlock further applications and ultimately to embed thermophilic red algae into a framework of circular and sustainable economic activity relying on bio-based sources.},

Experimental microcosms had two compartments; these contained either a single plant of Plantago lanceolata inoculated with Glomus hoi or Glomus intraradices, or a patch of dried shoot material labelled with (15)N and (13)carbon (C). In one treatment, hyphae, but not roots, were allowed access to the patch; in the other treatment, access by both hyphae and roots was prevented. When allowed, fungi proliferated in the patch and captured N but not C, although G. intraradices transferred more N than G. hoi to the plant. Plants colonized with G. intraradices had a higher concentration of N than controls. Up to one-third of the patch N was captured by the AM fungi and transferred to the plant, while c. 20\% of plant N may have been patch derived. These findings indicate that uptake from organic N could be important in AM symbiosis for both plant and fungal partners and that some AM fungi may acquire inorganic N from organic sources.},

The most frequently documented response is an increase in phosphorus nutrition; however, other effects have been noted, including increased resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Here we used a 16 000-feature oligonucleotide array and real-time quantitative RT-PCR to explore transcriptional changes triggered in Medicago truncatula roots and shoots as a result of AM symbiosis. By controlling the experimental conditions, phosphorus-related effects were minimized, and both local and systemic transcriptional responses to the AM fungus were revealed. The transcriptional response of the roots and shoots differed in both the magnitude of gene induction and the predicted functional categories of the mycorrhiza-regulated genes. In the roots, genes regulated in response to three different AM fungi were identified, and, through split-root experiments, an additional layer of regulation, in the colonized or non-colonized sections of the mycorrhizal root system, was uncovered. Transcript profiles of the shoots of mycorrhizal plants indicated the systemic induction of many genes predicted to be involved in stress or defense responses, and suggested that mycorrhizal plants might display enhanced disease resistance. Experimental evidence supports this prediction, and mycorrhizal M. truncatula plants showed increased resistance to a virulent bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas campestris. Thus, the symbiosis is accompanied by a complex pattern of local and systemic changes in gene expression, including the induction of a functional defense response.},

Galdieria maxima nom. inval. was classified in this genus based on morphology and molecular data in the early work, but some subsequent molecular phylogenetic analyses have inferred strains of G. maxima to be closely related to the genus Cyanidioschyzon. To address this controversy, an isolated strain identified as G. maxima using the rbcL gene sequence as the genetic barcode was examined using a comprehensive analysis across morphological, physiological, and genomic traits. Herein are reported the chloroplast-, mitochondrion-, and chromosome-level nuclear genome assemblies. Comparative analysis of orthologous gene clusters and genome arrangements suggested that the genome structure of this strain was more similar to that of the generitype of Cyanidioschyzon, C. merolae than to the generitype of Galdieria, G. sulphuraria. While the ability to uptake various forms of organic carbon for growth is an important physiological trait of Galdieria, this strain was identified as an ecologically obligate photoautotroph (i.e., the inability to utilize the natural concentrations of organic carbons) and lacked various gene models predicted as sugar transporters. Based on the genomic, morphological, and physiological traits, we propose this strain to be a new genus and species, Cyanidiococcus yangmingshanensis. Re-evaluation of the 18S rRNA and rbcL gene sequences of the authentic strain of G. maxima, IPPAS-P507, with those of C. yangmingshanensis suggests that the rbcL sequences of ``G. maxima'' deposited in GenBank correspond to misidentified isolates.},

Today, this endosymbiosis occurs broadly in the plant kingdom where it has a pronounced impact on plant mineral nutrition. The symbiosis develops deep within the root cortex with minimal alterations in the external appearance of the colonized root; however, the absence of macroscopic alterations belies the extensive signaling, cellular remodeling, and metabolic alterations that occur to enable accommodation of the fungal endosymbiont. Recent research has revealed the involvement of a novel N-acetyl glucosamine transporter and an alpha/beta-fold hydrolase receptor at the earliest stages of AM symbiosis. Calcium channels required for symbiosis signaling have been identified, and connections between the symbiosis signaling pathway and key transcriptional regulators that direct AM-specific gene expression have been established. Phylogenomics has revealed the existence of genes conserved for AM symbiosis, providing clues as to how plant cells fine-tune their biology to enable symbiosis, and an exciting coalescence of genome mining, lipid profiling, and tracer studies collectively has led to the conclusion that AM fungi are fatty acid auxotrophs and that plants provide their fungal endosymbionts with fatty acids. Here, we provide an overview of the molecular program for AM symbiosis and discuss these recent advances.},

We previously demonstrated that N-oxoacyl-homoserine lactone (OHL) is essential for quorum sensing in the soft-rot phytopathogen Erwinia carotovora. In this pathogen, OHL controls the coordinate activation of genes encoding the main virulence determinants, extracellular plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), in a cell density-dependent manner. We suggest that E. carotovora employ quorum sensing to avoid the premature production of PCWDEs and subsequent activation of plant defense responses. To test whether modulating this sensory system would affect the outcome of a plant-pathogen interaction, we generated transgenic tobacco, producing OHL. This was accomplished by ectopic expression in tobacco of the E. carotovora gene expI, which is responsible for OHL biosynthesis. We show that expI-positive transgenic tobacco lines produced the active pheromone and partially complemented the avirulent phenotype of expI mutants. The OHL-producing tobacco lines exhibited enhanced resistance to infection by wild-type E. carotovora. The results were confirmed by exogenous addition of OHL to wild-type plants, which also resulted in increased resistance to E. carotovora.},

This regulatory procedure, called ``quorum sensing'' (QS), depends on the synthesis and perception between bacteria of small signal molecules such as acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs). It is now evident that plants can listen to bacterial signals and respond in sophisticated ways to the information. The anti-QS activity of the methanolic extract of 44 plant species was detected through the inhibition of the QS-related violacein pigmentation in Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 in the presence of 5 mgl-1 of C6- homoserin lactone. In addition, the ability of test plants to produce AHL-mimicking compounds that excite QS-related response in CV026 was investigated. The results revealed that the QS inhibition activity was observed in the leaves and stem extracts of tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus), radish (Raphanus sativus) and hollyhock (Althea officinalis), which repress violacein production in CV026. We have also shown that Trifolium repens contains AHL- mimicking molecules that can activate QS function in biosensor bacterium and induce violacein production in CV026. Methanolic extracts were also able to inhibit QS-regulated virulence in Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum on potato tubers. The results suggest that plants have quorum sensing-mimicking signals that could potentially be used for disrupting quorum sensing of associated bacteria thus controlling their infections.},

We found that SYMRK exists in at least three different structural versions, of which the shorter forms from rice and tomato are sufficient for AM, but not for functional endosymbiosis with bacteria in the legume Lotus japonicus. Our data support the idea that SYMRK sequence evolution was involved in the recruitment of a pre-existing signalling network from AM, paving the way for the evolution of intracellular root symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.},

These are; the ectomycorrhizas (ECM), the ericoid mycorrhizas (EM), and the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas (VAM). Mycorrhizal infection may affect the mineral nutrition of the host plant directly by enhancing plant growth through nutrient acquisition by the fungus, or indirectly by modifying transpiration rates and the composition of rhizosphere microflora. A capacity for the external hyphae to take up and deliver nutrients to the plant has been demonstrated for the following nutrients and mycorrhizas; P (VAM, EM, ECM), NH4 + (VAM, EM, ECM), NO3 - (ECM), K (VAM, ECM), Ca (VAM, EM), SO4 2- (VAM), Cu (VAM), Zn (VAM) and Fe (EM). In experimental chambers, the external hyphae of VAM can deliver up to 80\% of plant P, 25\% of plant N, 10\% of plant K, 25\% of plant Zn and 60\% of plant Cu. Knowledge of the role of mycorrhiza in the uptake of nutrients other than P and N is limited because definitive studies are few, especially for the ECM. Although further quantification is required, it is feasible that the external hyphae may provide a significant delivery system for N, K, Cu and Zn in addition to P in many soils. Proposals that ECM and VAM fungi contribute substantially to the Mg, B and Fe nutrition of the host plant have not been substantiated. ECM and EM fungi produce ectoenzymes which provide host plants with the potential to access organic N and P forms that are normally unavailable to VAM fungi or to non mycorrhizal roots. The relative contribution of these nutrient sources requires quantification in the field. Further basic research, including the quantification of nutrient uptake and transport by fungal hyphae in soil and regulation at the fungal-plant interface, is essential to support the selection and utilization of mycorrhizal fungi on a commercial scal},

While artificial selection has shown that biochemical components can show rapid and dramatic evolution, it remains unclear as to whether intensive harvesting can inadvertently induce changes in the biochemistry of harvested populations. For applications such as algal culture, many of the desirable bioproducts could evolve in response to harvesting, reducing cost-effectiveness, but experimental tests are lacking. We used an experimental evolution approach where we imposed heavy and light harvesting regimes on multiple lines of an alga of commercial interest for twelve cycles of harvesting and then placed all lines in a common garden regime for four cycles. We have previously shown that lines in a heavy harvesting regime evolve a ``live fast'' phenotype with higher growth rates relative to light harvesting regimes. Here, we show that algal biochemistry also shows evolutionary responses, although they were temporarily masked by differences in density under the different harvesting regimes. Heavy harvesting regimes, relative to light harvesting regimes, had reduced productivity of desirable bioproducts, particularly fatty acids. We suggest that commercial operators wishing to maximize productivity of desirable bioproducts should maintain mother cultures, kept at higher densities (which tend to select for desirable phenotypes), and periodically restart their intensively harvested cultures to minimize the negative consequences of biochemical evolution. Our study shows that the burgeoning algal culture industry should pay careful attention to the role of evolution in intensively harvested crops as these effects are nontrivial if subtle.},

  abstract = {Quorum sensing relies upon the interaction of a diffusible signal molecule with a transcriptional activator protein to couple gene expression with cell population density. In Gram-negative bacteria, such signal molecules are usually N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) which differ in the structure of their N-acyl side chains. Chromobacterium violaceum, a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in soil and water, produces the characteristic purple pigmen violacein. Previously the authors described a violacein-negative, mini-Tn5 mutant of C. violaceum (CV026) in which pigment production can be restored by incubation with supernatants from the wild-type strain. To develop this mutant as a general biosensor for AHLs, the natural C. violaceum AHL molecule was first chemically characterized. By using solvent extraction, HPLC and mass spectrometry, a single AHL, N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (HHL), was identified in wild-type C. violaceum culture supernatants which was absent from CV026. Since the production of violacein constitutes a simple assay for the detection of AHLs, we explored the ability of CV026 to respond to a series of synthetic AHL and N-acylhomocysteine thiolactone (AHT) analogues. In CV026, violacein is inducible by ail the AHL and AHT compounds evaluated with N-acyl side chains from C4 to C8 in length, with varying degrees of sensitivity. Although AHL compounds with N-acyl side chains from C10 to C14 are unable to induce violacein production, if an activating AHL (e.g. HHL) is incorporated into the agar, these long-chain AHLs can be detected by their ability to inhibit violacein production. The versatility of CV026 in facilitating detection of AHL mixtures extracted from culture supernatants and separated by thin-layer chromatography is also demonstrated. These simple bioassays employing CV026 thus greatly extend the ability to detect a wide spectrum of AHL signa molecules.,},

Microorganisms can adapt/resist to metal stress, and some of them are able to promote the plants establishment and therefore the phytoremediation process. In this context, the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and their role in phytoremediation, has emerged as a new and interesting choice. In addition to AMF's well-known contribution to plant nutrient acquisition and growth, these fungi develop diverse mechanisms that encourage plants to grow in soils with high toxic metals concentrations. The authors are concerned about the AMF metal tolerance mechanisms and its role in the promotion of in phytoremediation processes.},

Laboratory cultures of these algae grow faster than plants and often provide homogeneous cellular populations exposed to an almost equal environment. These characteristics are ideal for conducting experiments at the cellular and subcellular levels. Many microalgal lineages have recently become genetically tractable, which have started to evoke new streams of studies. Among such algae, the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae is the simplest organism; it possesses the minimum number of membranous organelles, only 4,775 protein-coding genes in the nucleus, and its cell cycle progression can be highly synchronized with the diel cycle. These properties facilitate diverse omics analyses of cellular proliferation and structural analyses of the intracellular relationship among organelles. C. merolae cells lack a rigid cell wall and are thus relatively easily disrupted, facilitating biochemical analyses. Multiple chromosomal loci can be edited by highly efficient homologous recombination. The procedures for the inducible/repressive expression of a transgene or an endogenous gene in the nucleus and for chloroplast genome modification have also been developed. Here, we summarize the features and experimental techniques of C. merolae and provide examples of studies using this alga. From these studies, it is clear that C. merolae\textemdash either alone or in comparative and combinatory studies with other photosynthetic organisms\textemdash can provide significant insights into the biology of photosynthetic eukaryotes.},

The last decade has witnessed many significant advances in our understanding of plant\textendash microbe interactions with evidence that plants have evolved multiple strategies to cope with nitrogen limitation by shaping and recruiting nitrogen-cycling microbial communities. However, most studies have typically focused on the impact of plants on only one, or relatively few, processes within the nitrogen cycle. This review synthesizes recent advances in our understanding of the various routes by which plants influence the availability of nitrogen via an array of interactions with different guilds of nitrogen-cycling micro-organisms. We also propose a plant trait-based framework for linking plant nitrogen acquisition strategies to the activities of nitrogen-cycling microbial guilds. In doing so, we provide a more comprehensive picture of the ecological relationships between plants and nitrogen-cycling micro-organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, we identify previously overlooked processes within the nitrogen cycle that could be targeted in future research and be of interest for plant health or for improving plant nitrogen acquisition, while minimizing nitrogen inputs and losses in sustainable agricultural systems.

Although most red algae are marine species (both unicellular and macrophytic), the Cyanidiales class of red algae includes unicellular species which live in hot springs, such as Cyanidioschyzon merolae, which is a model species for biochemical and molecular biological studies. Lipid metabolism in red algae has previously been studied in intact cells. Here, we present the results of radiolabeling and stable isotope labeling experiments in intact plastids isolated from the unicellular red alga C. merolae. We focused on two uncommon features: First, the galactose moiety of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol was efficiently labeled with bicarbonate, indicating that an unknown pathway for providing UDP-galactose exists within the plastid. Second, saturated fatty acids, namely, palmitic and stearic acids, were the sole products of fatty acid synthesis in the plastid, and they were efficiently exported. This finding suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum is the sole site of desaturation. We present a general principle of red algal lipid biosynthesis, namely, 'indigenous C18 fatty acids are neither desaturated nor directly utilized within the plastid'. We believe that this is valid in both C. merolae lacking polyunsaturated fatty acids and marine red algae with a high content of arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids.},

  abstract = {Walnut trees are among the most important hardwood species in the northern hemisphere, ecologically and economically. They are mainly cultivated for timber and nut production but are also attractive ornamental trees in parks. Establishing walnut orchards is difficult because seedlings have a coarse root architecture and few of them survive to transplanting. Planting success is mainly determined by the root system morphology and the nutrient status of the seedlings, so that rhizosphere conditions are critical for plant performance. Walnut trees can associate with soil-borne arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which are obligate biotrophs. In this association, plant-produced carbon compounds are traded against fungus-acquired soil mineral nutrients. The beneficial effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis on hardwood seedling quality and field performance has long been known, but an integrated view is lacking about the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizas on walnut cropping. Therefore, we surveyed the literature published over the last 40~years to provide up-to-date knowledge on the relationships between arbuscular mycorrhizas and walnut trees. Our review outlines the major following points: (1) the arbuscular-mycorrhiza-mediated nutrient uptake capacity of walnut trees is associated with first- to third-order roots, and fibrous tip-ended roots are dependent on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whereas pioneer roots are not; (2) early inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improves the survival and seedling performance attributes of transplanted walnut trees: biotization enhances walnut transplant success by increasing the number of lateral roots and plant P uptake, but these benefits are fungus- and host-dependent; (3) in the context of walnut agroforestry, deeply rooted walnut trees play a role as reservoirs of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal propagules for the surrounding vegetation, but tree shade and soluble phosphate availability decrease walnut mycorrhizal dependency; and (4) the arbuscular mycorrhizal mycelium mediates the transport of juglone and thus plays a role in walnut tree allelopathy.},

The cost-benefits of the tripartite symbiosis were investigated in terms of C-economy and nutrition. Nodulated Phaseolus vulgaris seedlings, with and without AM, were hydroponically grown under high (2 mM) and low (1 {$\mu$}M) P conditions in an N-free Long Ashton nutrient solution. Plants were sequentially harvested at 17, 24 and 31 days after emergence. At each harvest, measurements for biomass, N2-fixation, photosynthesis, root respiration, calculated C and nutritional economy were taken. Nodular growth was suppressed by the early development of AM colonization. This coincided with higher photosynthetic and respiratory rates in AM plants. These effects were most pronounced under low P when AM colonization peaked. Once AM levels reached the plateau phase, the efficiency of P nutrition increased. This was followed by improved nodular and host growth and enhanced N2-fixation. This indicates that the AM was the dominant symbiont for host C in the tripartite symbiosis, due to its rapid development and subsequent role in supplying P more effectively to both host and nodules. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent advances reveal that phytohormones, microRNAs, and secreted peptides all regulate and integrate development of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis with the P status of the plant. This occurs through a complex, multi-layered signaling network with crosstalk between phosphate (Pi) starvation signaling pathways and AM symbiosis signaling, and also via direct effects on the AM fungal symbiont. Multiple checkpoints allow the plant to fine-tune symbiosis based on its P status.},

  abstract = {Climate change is happening due to natural factors and human activities. It expressively alters biodiversity, agricultural production, and food security. Mainly, narrowly adapted and endemic species are under extinction. Accordingly, concerns over species extinction are warranted as it provides food for all life forms and primary health care for more than 60\textendash 80\% of humans globally. Nevertheless, the impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security has been recognized, little is explored compared to the magnitude of the problem globally. Therefore, the objectives of this review are to identify, appraise, and synthesize the link between climate change, biodiversity, and food security. Data, climatic models, emission, migration, and extinction scenarios, and outputs from previous publications were used. Due to climate change, distributions of species have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 m and 16.9 km per decade to higher latitudes. Accordingly, extinction rates of 1103 species under migration scenarios, provide 21\textendash 23\% with unlimited migration and 38\textendash 52\% with no migration. When an environmental variation occurs on a timescale shorter than the life of the plant any response could be in terms of a plastic phenotype. However, phenotypic plasticity could buffer species against the long-term effects of climate change. Furthermore, climate change affects food security particularly in communities and locations that depend on rain-fed agriculture. Crops and plants have thresholds beyond which growth and yield are compromised. Accordingly, agricultural yields in Africa alone could be decline by more than 30\% in 2050. Therefore, solving food shortages through bringing extra land into agriculture and exploiting new fish stocks is a costly solution, when protecting biodiversity is given priority. Therefore, mitigating food waste, compensating food-insecure people conserving biodiversity, effective use of genetic resources, and traditional ecological knowledge could decrease further biodiversity loss, and meet food security under climate change scenarios. However, achieving food security under such scenario requires strong policies, releasing high-yielding stress resistant varieties, developing climate resilient irrigation structures, and agriculture. Therefore, degraded land restoration, land use changes, use of bio-energy, sustainable forest management, and community based biodiversity conservation are recommended to mitigate climate change impacts.},

Quantitative control supplied all nutrients once a day based on criteria for three application rates (1.0 \texttimes, 1.25 \texttimes, and 1.5 \texttimes{} the standard). These criteria were previously developed in the deep flow technique (DFT) to estimate their nutrient requirements, which used the three-day average amount of water absorbed by tomato plants. We compared the quantitative control in a closed system with two EC treatments in an open system, in which we supplied nutrient solution at high and low EC ranges. The 1.0 \texttimes{} quantity standard reduced the nutrient supply to 30\textendash 37\% of the levels used in the low-EC treatment. N, P, and K concentrations in the 1.0 \texttimes{} substrate solution remained low and stable for two months after transplanting. The 1.0 \texttimes{} treatment had 27\% lower total leaf dry weight and 23\% higher total fruit yield than the low-EC treatment. However, greatly reduced growth and nitrogen content of upper leaf and slightly lower soluble solids content in the fruits suggest that the 1.0 \texttimes{} standard might provide insufficient nutrients during late growth stages. Excessive nutrient supplies, which were much lower than the low-EC treatment, increased substrate salinity owing to the accumulation of nutrients during the latter half of the growth period in the 1.25 \texttimes{} and 1.5 \texttimes{} treatments. The stable EC and nutrient concentrations in the 1.0 \texttimes{} substrate solution over time suggest that the three-day adjustment interval would be short enough. The quantity criteria developed for the DFT system could generally be applied to long-term rockwool culture, but the optimum range of nutrient supply was found to be from 1.0 \texttimes{} to 1.25 \texttimes{} the DFT standard in the later growth stages.},

In this symbiotic association, the arbuscular interface is the main site for nutrient exchange. To understand phosphorus transfer at the interface, we analyzed the subcellular localization of polyphosphate (polyP) in mature arbuscules of Rhizophagus irregularis colonizing roots of Lotus japonicus wild-type (WT) and H+-ATPase ha1-1 mutant, which is defective in phosphorus acquisition through the mycorrhizal pathway. In both, the WT and the ha1-1 mutant, polyP accumulated in the cell walls of trunk hyphae and inside fine branch modules close to the trunk hyphae. However, many fine branches lacked polyP. In the mutant, most fine branch modules showed polyP signals compared to the WT. Notably, polyP was also observed in the cell walls of some fine branches formed in the ha1-1 mutant, indicating phosphorus release from fungal cells to the apoplastic regions. Intense acid phosphatase (ACP) activity was detected in the periarbuscular spaces around the fine branches. Furthermore, double staining of ACP activity and polyP revealed that these had contrasting distribution patterns in arbuscules. These observations suggest that polyP in fungal cell walls and apoplastic phosphatases may play an important role in phosphorus transfer at the symbiotic interface in arbuscules.},

First, fungal `trading agents' are hard to identify because AMFs are potentially heterokaryotic, that is, they may contain large numbers of polymorphic nuclei. This means it is difficult to define and study a fungal `individual' acting as an independent agent with a specific trading strategy. Second, because nutrient exchanges occur via communal structures (arbuscules), this temporarily reduces outbidding competition and transaction costs and hence resembles exchanges among divisions of firms, rather than traditional trade on markets. We discuss how fungal nuclei may coordinate their trading strategies, but nevertheless retain some independence, similar to human co-operatives (co-ops).},

  abstract = {All previously reported eukaryotic nuclear genome sequences have been incomplete, especially in highly repeated units and chromosomal ends. Because repetitive DNA is important for many aspects of biology, complete chromosomal structures are fundamental for understanding eukaryotic cells. Our earlier, nearly complete genome sequence of the hot-spring red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae revealed several unique features, including just three ribosomal DNA copies, very few introns, and a small total number of genes. However, because the exact structures of certain functionally important repeated elements remained ambiguous, that sequence was not complete. Obviously, those ambiguities needed to be resolved before the unique features of the C. merolae genome could be summarized, and the ambiguities could only be resolved by completing the sequence. Therefore, we aimed to complete all previous gaps and sequence all remaining chromosomal ends, and now report the first nuclear-genome sequence for any eukaryote that is 100\% complete. Our present complete sequence consists of 16546747 nucleotides covering 100\% of the 20 linear chromosomes from telomere to telomere, representing the simple and unique chromosomal structures of the eukaryotic cell. We have unambiguously established that the C. merolae genome contains the smallest known histone-gene cluster, a unique telomeric repeat for all chromosomal ends, and an extremely low number of transposons. By virtue of these attributes and others that we had discovered previously, C. merolae appears to have the simplest nuclear genome of the non-symbiotic eukaryotes. These unusually simple genomic features in the 100\% complete genome sequence of C. merolae are extremely useful for further studies of eukaryotic cells.},

  abstract = {Many bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to regulate phenotypes that ultimately benefit the bacterial population at high cell densities. These QS-dependent phenotypes are diverse and can have significant impacts on the bacterial host, including virulence factor production, motility, biofilm formation, bioluminescence, and root nodulation. As bacteria and their eukaryotic hosts have coevolved over millions of years, it is not surprising that certain hosts appear to be able to sense QS signals, potentially allowing them to alter QS outcomes. Recent experiments have established that eukaryotes have marked responses to the N-acyl l-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals used by Gram-negative bacteria for QS, and the responses of plants to AHLs have received considerable scrutiny to date. However, the molecular mechanisms by which plants, and eukaryotes in general, sense bacterial AHLs remain unclear. Herein, we report a systematic analysis of the responses of the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula to a series of native AHLs and byproducts thereof. Our results establish that AHLs can significantly alter seedling growth in an acyl-chain length dependent manner. Based upon A. thaliana knockout studies and in vitro biochemical assays, we conclude that the observed growth effects are dependent upon AHL amidolysis by a plant-derived fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) to yield l-homoserine. The accumulation of l-homoserine appears to encourage plant growth at low concentrations by stimulating transpiration, while higher concentrations inhibit growth by stimulating ethylene production. These results offer new insights into the mechanisms by which plant hosts can respond to QS signals and the potential role of QS in interkingdom associations.},

The uptake of 32P from the HC was equivalent to 7, 21 and 109 \% of the uptake of 33P from the RHC in plants colonized by S. calospora, Glomus sp. and G. caledonium, respectively. This indicates that the relative contribution of the roots in total P uptake varied greatly between the three mycorrhizal treatments. Although 33P uptake was variable within treatments, the P uptake systems of roots colonized by G. caledonium appeared to be inactive when compared to hyphal 32P uptake. This may have been due to feedback mechanisms being activated because of the high hyphal P uptake. The roots colonized by S. calospora had higher rates of root-P uptake compared with the control roots, suggesting that the root-P uptake systems have been stimulated by the presence of the fungus. This would ensure that the P supply was sufficient to maintain photosynthesis in this symbiosis where the fungus gives only little P in return for its use of plant carbon substrate from the host.},

  abstract = {Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) was grown in an irradiated soil:sand mixture in PVC tubes containing a root compartment, a hyphal compartment and a hyphal 32P-labelling compartment. The soil was inoculated with either Scutellospora calospora (Nicol. \& Gerd.) Walker \& Sanders, Glomus sp. or Glomus caledonium (Nicol. \& Gerd.) Trappe \& Gerdemann or left uninoculated. At 23 d from sowing 20 {$\mu$}Ci of an aqueous solution of carrier-free 32P was pipetted into the hyphal labelling compartment. Just 24 h later the plants were labelled with 14CO2 for 16 h. At harvest the plants were analysed for mycorrhizal colonization and distribution of 14C and 32P. Hyphae of G. caledonium proved to have the most rapid 32P uptake and transfer system of the three fungi studied. The host was provided with an order of magnitude more 32P than supplied by either Glomus sp. or S. calospora. The S. calospora-colonized plants contained the least 32P counts of the three mycorrhizal treatments. 75\% of the total 32P in the plant was present in the shoots of the plants colonized by G. caledonium; the corresponding figures for the shoots of S. calospora and Glomus sp. were 45 and 25\%, respectively. The proportion of assimilated 14C allocated to below-ground events was 35, 32 and 25 with S. calospora, Glomus sp. and G. caledonium, respectively. The specific incorporation of 14C into roots colonized by Glomus sp. was 1.8 and 3.1 times as high as into roots colonized by G. caledonium and S. calospora, respectively. In contrast, the specific root respiration (Bq mg-1 d. wt) was similar in the mycorrhizal treatments. The 14C flow into external hyphae was approximately 0.8\% of the total assimilated 14C for all three fungi. Based on these results, mycorrhizal efficiency was calculated as hyphal 14C use per unit 32P transported, below-ground 14C use per unit 32P transported, 32P transported per metre of hyphae and hyphal 14C use per metre of hyphae.},

QS-regulated genes are involved in complex interactions between bacteria of the same or different species and even with some eukaryotic organisms. Eukaryotes, including plants, can interfere with bacterial QS systems by synthesizing molecules that interfere with bacterial QS systems. In this work, the presence of AHL-mimic QS molecules in diverse Oryza sativa (rice) and Phaseolus vulgaris (bean) plant-samples were detected employing three biosensor strains. A more intensive analysis using biosensors carrying the lactonase enzyme showed that bean and rice seed-extract contain molecules that lack the typical lactone ring of AHLs. Interestingly, these molecules specifically alter the QS-regulated biofilm formation of two plant-associated bacteria, Sinorhizobium fredii SMH12 and Pantoea ananatis AMG501, suggesting that plants are able to enhance or to inhibit the bacterial QS systems depending on the bacterial strain. Further studies would contribute to a better understanding of plant\textendash bacteria relationships at the molecular level.},

Thanks to the symbiosis with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, cricaceous plants are also able to grow in highly polluted environments, where metal ions can reach toxic levels in the soil substrate. For a long time this mycorrhizal type has been regarded as an example of a highly specific interaction between plants and fungi. More recent studies have been challenging this view because some ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes seem also able to colonise plants from very distant taxa. A molecular approach has allowed the investigation of genetic diversity and molecular ecology of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, and has revealed that ericaceous plants can be very promiscuous, with multiple occupancy of their thin roots. The molecular analysis of sterile morphotypes involved in this symbiosis has also led to deeper understanding of the species diversity of ericoid fungi. Genetic polymorphism of ericoid fungi is wider than previously thought, and often increased by the presence of Group I introns in the nuclear small subunit rDNA.},

  abstract = {For survival, plants have to efficiently adjust their phenotype to environmental challenges, finely coordinating their responses to balance growth and defence. Such phenotypic plasticity can be modulated by their associated microbiota. The widespread mycorrhizal symbioses modify plant responses to external stimuli, generally improving the resilience of the symbiotic system to environmental stresses. Phytohormones, central regulators of plant development and immunity, are instrumental in orchestrating plant responses to the fluctuating environment, but also in the regulation of mycorrhizal symbioses. Exciting advances in the molecular regulation of phytohormone signalling are providing mechanistic insights into how plants coordinate their responses to environmental cues and mycorrhizal functioning.

Among the potential mechanisms involved in the resistance of mycorrhizal systems, the induction of plant defenses is the most controversial.

This modulation may impact plant responses to potential enemies by priming the tissues for a more efficient activation of defense mechanisms.},

Medicago truncatula plants were grown in previously sterilized cultivation substrate and inoculated or not with AMF isolate Rhizophagus irregularis `PH5' (M or NM, respectively) in two-compartment rhizoboxes. The compartments were separated or not with root-excluding meshes. A 15-step soil moisture gradient (maintained over 5 weeks) spanned generous water supply through strong water deficiency. Two radioisotopes (33P and 32P) were injected into the plant and distant compartments, respectively, to distinguish cumulative and immediate-term plant P uptake from either of the compartments at each moisture level. M plants were larger than NM plants at high and medium moisture levels and accumulated markedly more P throughout the whole gradient. The immediate-term P uptake did not differ between M and NM plants at high moisture, but at medium and low moistures, M plants acquired significantly more 33P than NM plants, even after accounting for differences in root biomass. Increased immediate-term P uptake by M plants grown under medium and low substrate moistures was probably due to complementary effect of direct hyphal uptake and indirect alterations of substrate hydraulic properties by AMF. This research illustrates that AMF remain functional part of plants even under severe drought stress and thus they should be considered when plant functioning under water deficiency is to be fully understood.},

In particular, constraint-based analyses of metabolic networks have gained considerable popularity for simulating cellular metabolism, of which flux balance analysis (FBA), is most widely used. Unlike mechanistic simulations that depend on accurate kinetic data, which are scarcely available, FBA is based on the principle of conservation of mass in a network, which utilizes the stoichiometric matrix and a biologically relevant objective function to identify optimal reaction flux distributions. FBA has been used to analyse genome-scale reconstructions of several organisms; it has also been used to analyse the effect of perturbations, such as gene deletions or drug inhibitions in silico. This article reviews the usefulness of FBA as a tool for gaining biological insights, advances in methodology enabling integration of regulatory information and thermodynamic constraints, and finally addresses the challenges that lie ahead. Various use scenarios and biological insights obtained from FBA, and applications in fields such metabolic engineering and drug target identification, are also discussed.

  abstract = {Background Seedling recruitment is essential to the sustainability of any plant population. Due to the minute nature of seeds and early-stage seedlings, orchid germination in situ was for a long time practically impossible to observe, creating an obstacle towards understanding seedling site requirements and fluctuations in orchid populations. The introduction of seed packet techniques for sowing and retrieval in natural sites has brought with it important insights, but many aspects of orchid seed and germination biology remain largely unexplored.Key Considerations The germination niche for orchids is extremely complex, because it is defined by requirements not only for seed lodging and germination, but also for presence of a fungal host and its substrate. A mycobiont that the seedling can parasitize is considered an essential element, and a great diversity of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota have now been identified for their role in orchid seed germination, with fungi identifiable as imperfect Rhizoctonia species predominating. Specificity patterns vary from orchid species employing a single fungal lineage to species associating individually with a limited selection of distantly related fungi. A suitable organic carbon source for the mycobiont constitutes another key requirement. Orchid germination also relies on factors that generally influence the success of plant seeds, both abiotic, such as light/shade, moisture, substrate chemistry and texture, and biotic, such as competitors and antagonists. Complexity is furthermore increased when these factors influence seeds/seedling, fungi and fungal substrate differentially.Conclusions A better understanding of germination and seedling establishment is needed for conservation of orchid populations. Due to the obligate association with a mycobiont, the germination niches in orchid species are extremely complex and varied. Microsites suitable for germination can be small and transient, and direct observation is difficult. An experimental approach using several levels of environmental manipulation/control is recommended.},

Therefore, QS is an obvious target for a novel class of antimicrobial drugs which would function to efficiently block reception of the cognate QS signals in vivo, and thereby be capable of inducing chemical attenuation of pathogens. As QS is not directly involved in processes essential for growth of the bacteria, inhibition of QS does not impose harsh selective pressure for development of resistance as with antibiotics. Numerous chemical libraries of both natural and synthetic origin have been screened and several QS-inhibitory compounds have been identified. In animal pulmonary infection models, such inhibitors have proven able to significantly improve clearing of the infecting bacteria and reduce mortality. In addition, several enzymes that are able to inactivate the bacterial QS signal molecules have been identified. This inactivation leads to blockage of QS-mediated virulence of plant pathogens in several models.,},

One reason may be that some rhizobia chemically manipulate the host, undermining the efficacy of sanctions. Here we show that the ethylene inhibitor, rhizobitoxine (Rtx), is an example of such a manipulation. Rtx-producing rhizobia decreased legume growth, but benefited relative to an isogenic, non-producing strain on the same plant by accumulating 47\% more of the storage lipid poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB).},

These are particularly interesting, either due to economic or sustainable aspects, and some applications have already reached the commercial stage of development. The added advantages of these symbiotic cultures are biomass, lipid, and other products productivity enhancement a better utilization of resources and the reduction or even elimination of process residues (including carbon dioxide and other greenhouse   gases) to conduct an increasingly greener biotechnology. Among the several symbiotic partners referred, the microalgae and yeast cultures are the most used. The interaction between these two microorganisms shows how to enhance the lipid production for biodiesel purposes compared with separated (stand-alone) cultures},

This symbiotic relationship is crucial for the nitrogen cycle, and understanding symbiotic mechanisms is a scientific challenge with direct applications in agronomy and plant development. Rhizobium etli is a bacteria which provides legumes with ammonia (among other chemical compounds), thereby stimulating plant growth. A genome-scale approach, integrating the biochemical information available for R. etli, constitutes an important step toward understanding the symbiotic relationship and its possible improvement. In this work we present a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction (iOR363) for R. etli CFN42, which includes 387 metabolic and transport reactions across 26 metabolic pathways. This model was used to analyze the physiological capabilities of R. etli during stages of nitrogen fixation. To study the physiological capacities in silico, an objective function was formulated to simulate symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Flux balance analysis (FBA) was performed, and the predicted active metabolic pathways agreed qualitatively with experimental observations. In addition, predictions for the effects of gene deletions during nitrogen fixation in Rhizobia in silico also agreed with reported experimental data. Overall, we present some evidence supporting that FBA of the reconstructed metabolic network for R. etli provides results that are in agreement with physiological observations. Thus, as for other organisms, the reconstructed genome-scale metabolic network provides an important framework which allows us to compare model predictions with experimental measurements and eventually generate hypotheses on ways to improve nitrogen fixation.},

  abstract = {The heavy metal pollution is a worldwide problem and has received a serious concern for the ecosystem and human health. In the last decade, remediation of the agricultural polluted soil has attracted great attention. Phytoremediation is one of the technologies that effectively alleviate heavy metal toxicity, however, this technique is limited to many factors contributing to low plant growth rate and nature of metal toxicities. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) assisted alleviation of heavy metal phytotoxicity is a cost-effective and environment-friendly strategy. AMF have a symbiotic relationship with the host plant. The bidirectional exchange of resources is a hallmark and also a functional necessity in mycorrhizal symbiosis. During the last few years, a significant progress in both physiological and molecular mechanisms regarding roles of AMF in the alleviation of heavy metals (HMs) toxicities in plants, acquisition of nutrients, and improving plant performance under toxic conditions of HMs has been well studied. This review summarized the current knowledge regarding AMF assisted remediation of heavy metals and some of the strategies used by mycorrhizal fungi to cope with stressful environments. Moreover, this review provides the information of both molecular and physiological responses of mycorrhizal plants as well as AMF to heavy metal stress which could be helpful for exploring new insight into the mechanisms of HMs remediation by utilizing AMF.},

  abstract = {Summary In addition to their well-recognized roles in plant nutrition and communities, mycorrhizas can influence the key ecosystem process of soil aggregation. Here we review the contribution of mycorrhizas, mostly focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), to soil structure at various hierarchical levels: plant community; individual root; and the soil mycelium. There are a suite of mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi can influence soil aggregation at each of these various scales. By extension of these mechanisms to the question of fungal diversity, it is recognized that different species or communities of fungi can promote soil aggregation to different degrees. We argue that soil aggregation should be included in a more complete ?multifunctional? perspective of mycorrhizal ecology, and that in-depth understanding of mycorrhizas/soil process relationships will require analyses emphasizing feedbacks between soil structure and mycorrhizas, rather than a uni-directional approach simply addressing mycorrhizal effects on soils. We finish the discussion by highlighting new tools, developments and foci that will probably be crucial in further understanding mycorrhizal contributions to soil structure. Contents Summary 41 I.

  abstract = {Plant growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are highly variable, ranging from mutualism in a wide range of plants, to antagonism in some non-mycorrhizal plant species and plants characteristic of disturbed environments. Many agricultural weeds are non mycorrhizal or originate from ruderal environments where AMF are rare or absent. This led us to hypothesize that AMF may suppress weed growth, a mycorrhizal attribute which has hardly been considered. We investigated the impact of AMF and AMF diversity (three versus one AMF taxon) on weed growth in experimental microcosms where a crop (sunflower) was grown together with six widespread weed species. The presence of AMF reduced total weed biomass with 47\% in microcosms where weeds were grown together with sunflower and with 25\% in microcosms where weeds were grown alone. The biomass of two out of six weed species was significantly reduced by AMF (-66\% \& -59\%) while the biomass of the four remaining weed species was only slightly reduced (-20\% to -37\%). Sunflower productivity was not influenced by AMF or AMF diversity. However, sunflower benefitted from AMF via enhanced phosphorus nutrition. The results indicate that the stimulation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in agro-ecosystems may suppress some aggressive weeds.},

  abstract = {In the coming years, more sustainable horticultural practices should be developed to guarantee greater yield and yield stability, in order to meet the increasing food global demand. An environmentally-friendly way to achieve the former objectives is represented by the biostimulant functions displayed by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). AMF support plant nutrition by absorbing and translocating mineral nutrients beyond the depletion zones of plant rhizosphere (biofertilisers) and induce changes in secondary metabolism leading to improved nutraceutical compounds. In addition, AMF interfere with the phytohormone balance of host plants, thereby influencing plant development (bioregulators) and inducing tolerance to soil and environmental stresses (bioprotector). Maximum benefits from AMF activity will be achieved by adopting beneficial farming practices (e.g. reduction of chemical fertilisers and biocides), by inoculating efficient AMF strains and also by the appropriate selection of plant host/fungus combinations. This review gives an up to date overview of the recent advances in the production of quality AMF inocula and in the biostimulant properties of AMF on plant health, nutrition and quality of horticultural crops (fruit trees, vegetables, flower crops and ornamentals). The agronomical, physiological and biochemical processes conferring tolerance to drought, salinity, nutrient deficiency, heavy metal contaminations and adverse soil pH in mycorrhizal plants are encompassed. In addition, the influence of bacterial interactions and farm management on AMF is discussed. Finally, the review identifies several future research areas relevant to AMF to exploit and improve the biostimulant effects of AMF in horticulture.},

  abstract = {Plants and microbes are dependent on chemical signals as a means of interkingdom communication. There are two predicted paths for the evolution of these signals. Ritualization is the oft-assumed pathway for the evolution of plant\textendash microbe communication systems. In this process, chemical signals, which benefit both receiver and sender, evolve from chemical cues, which benefit only the receiver. However, plant\textendash microbe signaling may evolve from coercive interactions as well, a process known as sensory manipulation. Here, we aim to highlight the prevalence of coercive interactions and discuss sensory manipulation in the context of plant\textendash microbe interactions. We present two examples of stabilized coercion: microbial coercion of plants via the release of phytohormones and plant coercion of microbes via manipulation of quorum-sensing compounds. Furthermore, we provide an evolutionary framework for the emergence of signaling from coercive plant\textendash microbe interactions through the process of sensory manipulation. We hope that researchers will recognize the relevance of coercive interactions in plant\textendash microbe systems and consider sensory manipulation as a plausible evolutionary trajectory for the emergence of plant\textendash microbe signaling.},

Local adaptation to biotic interactions may be particularly important for plants, as they associate with microbial symbionts that can significantly affect their fitness and may enable rapid evolution. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is ideal for investigations of local adaptation because it is globally widespread among most plant taxa and can significantly affect plant growth and fitness. Using meta-analysis on 1170 studies (from 139 papers), we investigated the potential for local adaptation to shape plant growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation.},

However, experimental evaluations of the hyphal contribution to the total water uptake and the assessment of the bulk flow velocity in the hyphae are so far contradictory. Barley (Hordeum vulgaris L. Scarlet) with the inoculum Glomus intraradices was grown in a split plant-hyphal chamber with a 5~mm air gap. During the preparation of the chambers with a loamy-silt soil, water content sensors were inserted in each of the plant and the hyphal compartments. These sensors allow non-destructive measurements with high resolution. In total, 8 drying periods with a length of several days were applied with repeated watering following each drying period. A clear decline in water content in the hyphal compartment during each drying period supports the ability of hyphae to transfer water into the plant compartment. The difference between the decline in the hyphal compartment with and without arbuscular mycorrhyzal fungi is significant at the p\,{$<$}\,0.000001 level. The direct and indirect hyphal contribution to the total water uptake was estimated to be about 20\%. The application of capacitance sensors for water content determination with a special geometry adapted to the plant-hyphal chambers allows the evaluation of the hyphal water flow with high accuracy.},

In this symbiosis, the fungus provides the plant host with mineral nutrients, especially phosphate, receiving in turn carbohydrates.'' In the last years, the mycorrhiza research field has witnessed a big step forward in the knowledge of the physiology and the mechanisms governing this important symbiosis, that helped plants colonizing the lands more than 400 MYA. The huge expansion of the -omics studies produced the first results on the fungal side, with genomes and transcriptomes of AM fungi being published. In parallel, the need for more sustainable agricultural practices has boosted the research in the field of the plant symbioses, with the final aim of improving plant productivity employing symbiotic microbes as bioinoculants. Beside all the other (positive) effects that mycorrhizal fungi exert on plants, the nutrient exchange is considered as the keystone, and the core mechanism governing this symbiosis. This review will focus on the molecular determinants underneath this exchange, both on the fungal and the plant side. Coming back to the sentence that claims this symbiosis as based on phosphate provided to the plant in return to carbohydrate, we will find that some concepts of this view still stand, while some others have been partly revolutionized.},

These are the less investigated mycorrhizae helper bacteria (MHB), which constitute a dense, active bacterial community, tightly associated with AMF, and involved in the development and functioning of AMF. Although AMF spores are known to host several bacteria in their spore walls and cytoplasm, their role in promoting the ecological fitness and establishment of AMF symbiosis by influencing spore germination, mycelial growth, root colonization, metabolic diversity, and biocontrol of soil borne diseases is now being deciphered. MHB also promote the functioning of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by triggering various plant growth factors, leading to better availability of nutrients in the soil and uptake by plants. In order to develop strategies to promote mycorrhization by AMF, and particularly to stimulate the ability to utilize phosphorus from the soil, there is a need to decipher crucial metabolic signalling pathways of MHB and elucidate their functional significance as mycorrhiza helper bacteria. MHB, also referred to as AMF bioenhancers, also improve agronomic efficiency and formulations using AMF along with enriched population of MHB are a promising option. This review covers the aspects related to the specificity and mechanisms of action of MHB, which positively impact the formation and functioning of AMF in mycorrhizal symbiosis, and the need to advocate MHB as AMF bioenhancers towards their inclusion in integrated nutrient management practices in sustainable agriculture.},

Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plant growth, however, anthropogenic N loading (e.g. crop fertilization and deposition from combustion sources) is increasing so that N now threatens ecosystem sustainability around the world by causing terrestrial and aquatic eutrophication and acidification. It is impor- tant to better understand the capacity of AMF to directly uptake N from soils and transfer it to host plants because this process may increase N recycling and retention within ecosystems. In addition to understanding the role of AMF in the N cycle in the present day it is important to understand how AMF function may change as global change proceeds. Currently the net effects of N enrichment and elevated temperature predicted with global change on AMF are unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of N enrichment by simulated N- deposition loading, elevated temperatures expected by future global changes and their interactions on growth and AMF-mediated N acquisition of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum var. Alamo), an important species for biofuel production. Switchgrass plants were grown in microcosm units that divided mycorrhizal roots from AMF hyphae and organic residues enriched with 15N by compartments separated by an air gap to reduce N diffusion. While AMF did not enhance switchgrass biomass, mycorrhizas significantly increased 15N in shoots and total shoot N. Neither N enrichment nor elevated temperatures influenced this mycorrhizal-mediated N uptake and transfer. Results from this study can aid in developing sustainable bioethanol and switchgrass production prac- tices that are less reliant on synthetic fertilizers and more dependent on internal N recycling from AMF.},

  abstract = {Plants are organisms composed of modules connected by xylem and phloem transport streams. Attack by both insects and pathogens elicits sometimes rapid defense responses in the attacked module. We have also known for some time that proteins are often reallocated away from pathogen-infected tissues, while the same infection sites may draw carbohydrates to them. This has been interpreted as a tug of war in which the plant withdraws critical resources to block microbial growth while the microbes attempt to acquire more resources. Sink-source regulated transport among modules of critical resources, particularly carbon and nitrogen, is also altered in response to attack. Insects and jasmonate can increase local sink strength, drawing carbohydrates that support defense production. Shortly after attack, carbohydrates may also be drawn to the root. The rate and direction of movement of photosynthate or signals in phloem in response to attack is subject to constraints that include branching, degree of connection among tissues, distance between sources and sinks, proximity, strength, and number of competing sinks, and phloem loading/unloading regulators. Movement of materials (e.g., amino acids, signals) to or from attack sites in xylem is less well understood but is partly driven by transpiration. The root is an influential sink and may regulate sink-source interactions and transport above and below ground as well as between the plant and the rhizosphere and nearby, connected plants. Research on resource translocation in response to pathogens or herbivores has focused on biochemical mechanisms; whole-plant research is needed to determine which, if any, of these plant behaviors actually influence plant fitness.},

This article reviews the merits of these approaches, and argues that the former is to be preferred, so long as we demand that both the signal and the response be adaptive, rather than just one or the other, as is common. Specific concerns with the definition are addressed, and it is then explained why an account of communication predicated on information transfer is necessarily derivative upon such an approach. Other alternatives and some variants of the adaptationist definition are also briefly discussed.},

The RPE could be induced by several mechanisms including root exudates, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and root litter. However the contribution of each of these to rhizosphere priming is unknown due to the complexity involved in studying rhizospheric processes. In order to determine the role of each of these mechanisms, we incubated soils enclosed in nylon meshes that were permeable to exudates, or exudates \& AMF or exudates, AMF and roots under three grassland plant species grown on sand. Plants were continuously labeled with 13C depleted CO2 that allowed distinguishing plant-derived CO2 from soil-derived CO2. We show that root exudation was the main way by which plants induced RPE (58e96\% of total RPE) followed by root litter. AMF did not contribute to rhizosphere priming under the two species that were significantly colonized by them i.e. Poa trivialis and Trifolium repens. Root exudates and root litter differed with respect to their mechanism of inducing RPE. Exudates induced RPE without increasing microbial biomass whereas root litter increased microbial biomass and raised the RPE mediating saprophytic fungi. The RPE efficiency (RPE/unit plant-C assimilated into microbes) was 3e7 times higher for exudates than for root litter. This efficiency of exudates is explained by a microbial allocation of fresh carbon to mineralization activity rather than to growth. These results suggest that root exudation is the main way by which plants stimulated mineralization of soil organic matter. Moreover, the plants through their exudates not only provide energy to soil microorganisms but also seem to control the way the energy is used in order to maximize soil organic matter mineralization and drive their own nutrient supply.},

This review discusses the recent progress and challenges in our understanding of the characteristics, functions, ecology and models of mycorrhizal networks, with the goal of encouraging future research to improve our understanding of their ecology, adaptability and evolution. We focus on four themes in the recent literature: (1) the physical, physiological and molecular evidence for the existence of mycorrhizal networks, as well as the genetic characteristics and topology of networks in natural ecosystems; (2) the types, amounts and mechanisms of interplant material transfer (including carbon, nutrients, water, defence signals and allelochemicals) in autotrophic, mycoheterotrophic or partial mycoheterotrophic plants, with particular focus on carbon transfer; (3) the influence of mycorrhizal networks on plant establishment, survival and growth, and the implications for community diversity or stability in response to environmental stress; and (4) insights into emerging methods for modelling the spatial configuration and temporal dynamics of mycorrhizal networks, including the inclusion of mycorrhizal networks in conceptual models of complex adaptive systems. We suggest that mycorrhizal networks are fundamental agents of complex adaptive systems (ecosystems) because they provide avenues for feedbacks and cross-scale interactions that lead to selforganization and emergent properties in ecosystems. We have found that research in the genetics of mycorrhizal networks has accelerated rapidly in the past 5 y with increasing resolution and throughput of molecular tools, but there still remains a large gap between understanding genes and understanding the physiology, ecology and evolution of mycorrhizal networks in our changing environment. There is now enormous and exciting potential for mycorrhizal researchers to address these higher level questions and thus inform ecosystem and evolutionary research more broadly.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P)-deficiency is a significant challenge for agricultural productivity on many highly P-sorbing weathered and tropical soils throughout the world. On these soils it can be necessary to apply up to five-fold more P as fertiliser than is exported in products. Given the finite nature of global P resources, it is important that such inefficiencies be addressed. For low P-sorbing soils, P-efficient farming systems will also assist attempts to reduce pollution associated with P losses to the environment. P-balance inefficiency of farms is associated with loss of P in erosion, runoff or leaching, uneven dispersal of animal excreta, and accumulation of P as sparingly-available phosphate and organic P in the soil. In many cases it is possible to minimise P losses in runoff or erosion. Uneven dispersal of P in excreta typically amounts to \textasciitilde 5\% of P-fertiliser inputs. However, the rate of P accumulation in moderate to highly P-sorbing soils is a major contributor to inefficient P-fertiliser use. We discuss the causal edaphic, plant and microbial factors in the context of soil P management, P cycling and productivity goals of farms. Management interventions that can alter P-use efficiency are explored, including better targeted P-fertiliser use, organic amendments, removing other constraints to yield, zone management, use of plants with low critical-P requirements, and modified farming systems. Higher productivity in low-P soils, or lower P inputs in fertilised agricultural systems can be achieved by various interventions, but it is also critically important to understand the agroecology of plant P nutrition within farming systems for improvements in P-use efficiency to be realised.},

They thrive in acidic, moderately high-temperature habitats typically associated with geothermally active regions, although much remains to be learned about their distribution and diversity within such extreme environments. We focused on Yellowstone National Park (YNP), using culture-dependent efforts in combination with a park-wide environmental polymerase chain reaction (PCR) survey to examine Cyanidiales diversity and distribution in aqueous (i.e. submerged), soil and endolithic environments. Phylogenetic reconstruction of Cyanidiales biodiversity demonstrated the presence of Cyanidioschyzon and Galdieria lineages exhibiting distinct habitat preferences. Cyanidioschyzon was the only phylotype detected in aqueous environments, but was also prominent in moist soil and endolithic habitats, environments where this genus was thought to be scarce. Galdieria was found in soil and endolithic samples, but absent in aqueous habitats. Interestingly, Cyanidium could not be found in the surveys, suggesting this genus may be absent or rare in YNP. Direct microscopic counts and viable counts from soil samples collected along a moisture gradient were positively correlated with moisture content, providing the first in situ evidence that gravimetric moisture is an important environmental parameter controlling distribution of these algae. Significance and Impact of the Study The Cyanidiales are an order of unicellular eukaryotic algae that thrive in acidic geothermal environments. In this study, we report several novel observations relative to Cyanidiales ecology in Yellowstone National Park, including the following: (i) the identification of two phylogenetic lineages of Cyanidiales: Cyanidioschyzon and Galdieria; (ii) the absence of Galdieria in aquatic environments; (iii) the absence of Cyanidium and Galdieria phlegrea in prime Cyanidiales habitats; (iv) the cohabitation of Cyanidioschyzon and Galdieria in nonaqueous environments; and (v) the first in situ evidence regarding the relationship between soil moisture and Cyanidiales habitat preference and viability},

  abstract = {Recent research on arbuscular mycorrhizas has demonstrated that AM fungi play a significant role in plant phosphorus (P) uptake, regardless of whether the plant responds positively to colonization in terms of growth or P content. Here we focus particularly on implications of this finding for consideration of the balance between organic carbon (C) use by the fungi and P delivery (i.e. the C\textendash P trade between the symbionts). Positive growth responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization are attributed frequently to increased P uptake via the fungus, which results in relief of P deficiency and increased growth. Zero AM responses, compared with non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants, have conventionally been attributed to failure of the fungi to deliver P to the plants. Negative responses, combined with excessive C use, have been attributed to this failure. The fungi were viewed as parasites. Demonstration that the AM pathway of P uptake operates in such plants indicates that direct P uptake by the roots is reduced and that the fungi are not parasites but mutualists because they deliver P as well as using C. We suggest that poor plant growth is the result of P deficiency because AM fungi lower the amount of P taken up directly by roots but the AM uptake of P does compensate for the reduction. The implications of interplay between direct root uptake and AM fungal uptake of P also include increased tolerance of AM plants to toxins such as arsenate and increased success when competing with NM plants. Finally we discuss the new information on C\textendash P trade in the context of control of the symbiosis by the fungus or the plant, including new information (from NM plants) on sugar transport and on the role of sucrose in the signaling network involved in responses of plants to P deprivation.},

Flax (Linum usitatissimum) responded positively to all fungi, and medic (Medicago truncatula) to Glomus caledonium and G. intraradices, but not Gigaspora rosea.

G. intraradices delivered close to 100\% of the P in all three plants. G. caledonium and Gi. rosea delivered less P. The amount was not related to colonisation or to growth or P responses. \textbullet{} We conclude that: AM colonisation can result in complete inactivation of the direct P uptake pathway via root hairs and epidermis; calculations of AM contributions to P uptake from total plant P will often be highly inaccurate; and lack of plant responsiveness does not mean that an AM fungus makes no contribution to P uptake.},

  abstract = {This review brings together recent work on the coordination of transport processes between fungus and plant symbionts in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses, and focuses on new information on the diversity in structure and function of interfaces and their potential roles in transport processes. We consider the way that fungal activity is polarised to absorb mineral nutrients (especially phosphorus, P) in soil, transport them to the root and release them to the plant. Conversely, the fungal structures within the root appear to be specialised to absorb sugars, which the external mycelium cannot do. The external mycelium depends on a supply of lipid, transported from within the root. High affinity P transporters expressed in the root apices and root hairs of non-mycorrhizal roots, and most probably mycorrhizal roots, absorb P actively. This can result in the development of P depletion zones, so that a low concentration of P at the absorbing surfaces limits further uptake. The external hyphae of AM fungi extend well beyond the depletion zone, accessing supplies of P at a distance and in narrow soil pores, that is absorbed actively by a high affinity P transporter expressed in these small diameter hyphae. Translocation of P within the hyphae and transfer to the plant results in much higher rates of uptake (inflows) by mycorrhizal than non-mycorrhizal roots. The possible role of polyphosphate (polyP) in this process is discussed in the light of new data. Within the root, P is lost from the fungal structures to the interfacial apoplast by an unknown mechanism, and is absorbed by the root cortical cells. The expression of a high affinity P transporter and H + -ATPase in arbuscule-containing cells indicates that these are probably the sites of fungus/plant P transfer. The site of sugar transfer from plant to fungus has not yet been established. At the whole plant level, plant uptake systems located in the youngest regions of the root are positioned to absorb P from undepleted soil, into which the root apex has just grown. In older regions of the roots, colonised by mycorrhizal fungi, the external mycelium will take over the absorptive role and overcome the difficulties posed by the slow diffusion of P in soil.},

The obligate biotrophic nature of AM fungi imposes limitations in inoculum production which could be used in the management of the symbiosis in field crops. Glomus intraradices was grown on genetically transformed Daucus carota roots in a two-compartment in vitro system. The growth of mycorrhizal roots was restricted to one compartment (proximal) containing a complete growth medium. Only the endosymbiont was permitted to grow on to the second compartment (distal) containing the same medium lacking sugar. Colonization of the distal compartment by the mycelium took place between six and eight weeks after subculturing the mycorrhizal roots in the proximal compartment. Hyphal- and spore-densities were significantly higher in the distal compartment. Up to 34000 spores with a mean of 15 000 mostly viable spores per plate were counted in the distal compartment. This opens the possibility of producing aseptic spores, not only for research purposes but also for large-scale inoculum production. The possible factors involved in the enhancement of hyphal- and spore-densities and their ecological role are discussed.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent, globally important, greenhouse gas, predominantly released from agricultural soils during nitrogen (N) cycling. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form a mutualistic symbiosis with two-thirds of land plants, providing phosphorus and/or N in exchange for carbon. As AMF acquire N, it was hypothesized that AMF hyphae may reduce N2O production. AMF hyphae were either allowed (AMF) or prevented (nonAMF) access to a compartment containing an organic matter and soil patch in two independent microcosm experiments. Compartment and patch N2O production was measured both before and after addition of ammonium and nitrate. In both experiments, N2O production decreased when AMF hyphae were present before inorganic N addition. In the presence of AMF hyphae, N2O production remained low following ammonium application, but increased in the nonAMF controls. By contrast, negligible N2O was produced following nitrate application to either AMF treatment. Thus, the main N2O source in this system appeared to be via nitrification, and the production of N2O was reduced in the presence of AMF hyphae. It is hypothesized that AMF hyphae may be outcompeting slow-growing nitrifiers for ammonium. This has significant global implications for our understanding of soil N cycling pathways and N2O production.},

  abstract = {The effect of gibberellin (GA) on promoting stem growth was first discovered in 1930s by studies of the Bakanae(foolish seedling) disease in rice (57). Gibberella fujikuroi, a pathogenic fungus, produces gibberellic acid (GA3) that causes the infected rice plants to grow so tall that they fall over. Later studies of dwarf mutants and analysis of their GA contents revealed that bioactive GAs are endogenous hormones that regulate the natural developmental processes including stem growth in plants. An increase in both cell elongation and cell division occurs during stem growth. GA induces transcription of genes involved in these processes. For example, expression of some of the genes encoding xyloglucan endotransglycosylases (XETs1) and expansins are upregulated by GA in elongating internodes in rice and in Arabidopsis (7, 62, 66). XET is thought to increase the plasticity of the cell wall because this enzyme is involved in xyloglucan reorganization through cleaving and re-ligating xyloglucan polymers in the cell wall. Expansins are also extracellular proteins that cause plant cell wall loosening, probably by disrupting the polysaccharide adhesion. Transcripts of the genes encoding for cyclin-dependent protein kinases are also elevated in intercalary meristem in rice after GA treatment (12).},

Inoculation of common bean plants with the AM fungi resulted in a significant increase in nodulation compared to plants without inoculation. The combined inoculation of AM fungi and rhizobia significantly increased various plant growth parameters compared to simple inoculated plants. In addition, the combined inoculation of AM fungi and rhizobia resulted in significantly higher nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation in the shoots of common bean plants and improved phosphorus use efficiency compared with their controls, which were not dually inoculated.

In green algae, starch accumulation precedes TAG accumulation, and the starch is thought to be a substrate for TAG synthesis. However, the relationship between TAG synthesis and the starch content in red algae, as well as how TAG accumulation is regulated, is unclear. In this study, we cultured the primitive red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae under nitrogen-depleted conditions, and monitored the formation of starch granules (SGs) and LBs using microscopy. SGs stained with potassium iodide were observed at 24 h; however, LBs stained specifically with BODIPY 493/503 were observed after 48 h. Quantitative analysis of neutral sugar and cytomorphological semi-quantitative analysis of TAG accumulation also supported these results. Thus, the accumulation of starch occurred and preceded the accumulation of TAG in cells of C. merolae. However, TAG accumulation was not accompanied by a decrease in the starch content, suggesting that the starch is a major carbon storage sink, at least under nitrogen-depleted conditions. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the mRNA levels of genes involved in starch and TAG synthesis rarely changed during the culture period, suggesting that starch and TAG synthesis in C. merolae are not controlled through gene transcription but at other stages, such as translation and/or enzymatic activity.},

In order to coordinate the formation of these biofilms, microorganisms use a cell-to-cell communication system called quorum sensing (QS). As formation of biofilms on vascular plants may not be advantageous to the hosts, plants have developed inhibitors to interfere with these processes. In this mini review, research papers published on plant-derived molecules that have microbial biofilm or quorum sensing inhibition are reviewed with the objectives of determining the biosynthetic classes of active compounds, their biological activity in assays, and their families of occurrence and range. The main findings are the identification of plant phenolics, including benzoates, phenyl propanoids, stilbenes, flavonoids, gallotannins, proanthocyanidins and coumarins as important inhibitors with both activities. Some terpenes including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and triterpenes also have anti-QS and anti-biofilm activities. Relatively few alkaloids were reported. Quinones and organosulfur compounds, especially from garlic, were also active. A common feature is the polar nature of these compounds. Phytochemicals with these activities are widespread in Angiosperms in temperate and tropical regions, but gymnosperms, bryophytes and pteridophytes were not represented.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can enhance nutrient acquisition by a plant via their extraradical hyphae. This is particularly true for phosphorus, but the case for nitrogen (N) has been less clear. In our growth systems there was a small air-gap between root and hyphal compartments, which eliminated diffusion of nutrients between compartments. Moreover, our methods allowed us to distinguish between nitrate and ammonium. We found that N transfer to Zea maize L. depends on the sources fed to the hyphae of Glomus aggregatum Schenck \& Smith. In experiment 1, despite the fact that plant demand for N was already met, plants received 10 times as much 15N from ammonium than from nitrate. In experiment 2, 74\% of shoot-N was derived from the slow-release urea added to the hyphal compartment while only 2.9\% was derived from the nitrate-N. Intraradical hyphae isolated from roots contained a considerable amount of 15N in the cell wall even when 15N-nitrate was the source. We conclude that the mycorrhizal fungus can rapidly deliver ammonium-N to the plants, and that while the fungus can absorb nitrate, it apparently lacks the capacity to transfer it to the plant.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa, is a preeminent model for studying nitrogen fixation, symbiosis, and legume genomics. The Medicago sequencing project began in 2003 with the goal to decipher sequences originated from the euchromatic portion of the genome. The initial sequencing approach was based on a BAC tiling path, culminating in a BAC-based assembly (Mt3.5) as well as an in-depth analysis of the genome published in 2011.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Here we describe a further improved and refined version of the M. truncatula genome (Mt4.0) based on de novo whole genome shotgun assembly of a majority of Illumina and 454 reads using ALLPATHS-LG. The ALLPATHS-LG scaffolds were anchored onto the pseudomolecules on the basis of alignments to both the optical map and the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) map. The Mt4.0 pseudomolecules encompass {\~ }360 Mb of actual sequences spanning 390 Mb of which {\~ }330 Mb align perfectly with the optical map, presenting a drastic improvement over the BAC-based Mt3.5 which only contained 70\% sequences ({\~ }250 Mb) of the current version. Most of the sequences and genes that previously resided on the unanchored portion of Mt3.5 have now been incorporated into the Mt4.0 pseudomolecules, with the exception of {\~ }28 Mb of unplaced sequences. With regard to gene annotation, the genome has been re-annotated through our gene prediction pipeline, which integrates EST, RNA-seq, protein and gene prediction evidences. A total of 50,894 genes (31,661 high confidence and 19,233 low confidence) are included in Mt4.0 which overlapped with {\~ }82\% of the gene loci annotated in Mt3.5. Of the remaining genes, 14\% of the Mt3.5 genes have been deprecated to an "unsupported" status and 4\% are absent from the Mt4.0 predictions.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Mt4.0 and its associated resources, such as genome browsers, BLAST-able datasets and gene information pages, can be found on the JCVI Medicago web site (http://www.jcvi.org/medicago). The assembly and annotation has been deposited in GenBank (BioProject: PRJNA10791). The heavily curated chromosomal sequences and associated gene models of Medicago will serve as a better reference for legume biology and comparative genomics.},

  abstract = {Invasive nonindigenous plant species (NIPS) threaten native diversity, alter ecosystem processes, and may interact with other components of global environmental change. Here, a general framework is outlined that attempts to connect patterns of plant invasion to processes underlying these patterns at four well-established spatiotemporal stages of the invasion process: transport, colonization, establishment, and landscape spread. At each stage we organize findings and ideas about the filters that limit NIPS success and the interaction of these filters with historical aspects of introduction events, NIPS traits, and ecosystem properties. While it remains difficult to draw conclusions about the risk of invasion across ecosystems, to delineate universal `invader traits', or to predict large-scale extinctions following invasions, this review highlights the growing body of research that suggests that the success of invasive NIPS is controlled by a series of key processes or filters. These filters are common to all invasion events, and will interact throughout the stages of plant invasion, although the relative importance of a filter may be stage, species or location specific. It is suggested that both research and management programs may benefit from employing multiscale and stage approaches to studying and controlling invasion. We further use the framework to briefly examine potential interactions between climate change and filters that limit NIPS invasion.},

In the last 15 years, however, many key crop yields have plateaued. Climate change, an ever-increasing human population, depletion of global rock-phosphorus and growing energy prices make current fertiliser production unsustainable and represent sizeable challenges to global food security. Many important crops form symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and this has motivated the development of novel approaches in crop breeding and agricultural practices to support and promote AMF in agroecosystems. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal symbiosis can be high beneficial in crops and wider agroecosystems in many ways, including improved soil structure and resistance to pests. However, AMF colonisation does not necessarily translate directly into enhanced plant performance or crop yield, while land management practices that would encourage mycorrhiza\textendash crop associations, such as low-till or minimal chemical input often incur yield-reducing trade-offs.

We draw on ecological knowledge of AMF to inform their role in agroecosystems, providing a balanced look at mycorrhiza\textendash crop symbioses in terms of plant ecophysiology and the wider role of AMF in agroecosystems and ask the question: are AMF our sustainable saviours?},

While inorganic N fertilization has been shown to elicit strong mutualism, characterized by improved plant and fungal growth and mineral nutrition, similar responses following organic N addition are lacking. Using a compartmented microcosm experiment, we determined the significance to a mycorrhizal plant of placing a 15N-labelled, nitrogen-rich patch of organic matter in a compartment to which only AMF hyphae had access. Control microcosms denied AMF hyphal access to the patch compartment. When permitted access to the patch compartment, the fungus proliferated extensively in the patch and transferred substantial quantities of N to the plant. Moreover, our data demonstrate that allowing hyphal access to an organic matter patch enhanced total plant N and P contents, with a simultaneous and substantial increase in plant biomass. Furthermore, we demonstrate that organic matter fertilization of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants can foster a mutually beneficial symbiosis based on nitrogen transfer, a phenomenon previously thought irrelevant.},

AM fungi can take up both nitrate and ammonium from the soil and transfer nitrogen (N) to host roots in nutritionally substantial quantities. The current model of N handling in the AM symbiosis includes the synthesis of arginine in the extraradical mycelium and the transfer of arginine to the intraradical mycelium, where it is broken down to release N for transfer to the host plant. To understand the mechanisms and regulation of N transfer from the fungus to the plant, 11 fungal genes putatively involved in the pathway were identified from Glomus intraradices, and for six of them the full-length coding sequence was functionally characterized by yeast complementation. Two glutamine synthetase isoforms were found to have different substrate affinities and expression patterns, suggesting different roles in N assimilation. The spatial and temporal expression of plant and fungal N metabolism genes were followed after nitrate was added to the extraradical mycelium under N-limited growth conditions using hairy root cultures. In parallel experiments with (15)N, the levels and labeling of free amino acids were measured to follow transport and metabolism. The gene expression pattern and profiling of metabolites involved in the N pathway support the idea that the rapid uptake, translocation, and transfer of N by the fungus successively trigger metabolic gene expression responses in the extraradical mycelium, intraradical mycelium, and host plant.},

  abstract = {The mutualistic symbiosis involving Glomeromycota, a distinctive phylum of early diverging Fungi, is widely hypothesized to have promoted the evolution of land plants during the middle Paleozoic. These arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) perform vital functions in the phosphorus cycle that are fundamental to sustainable crop plant productivity. The unusual biological features of AMF have long fascinated evolutionary biologists. The coenocytic hyphae host a community of hundreds of nuclei and reproduce clonally through large multinucleated spores. It has been suggested that the AMF maintain a stable assemblage of several different genomes during the life cycle, but this genomic organization has been questioned. Here we introduce the 153-Mb haploid genome of Rhizophagus irregularis and its repertoire of 28,232 genes. The observed low level of genome polymorphism (0.43 SNP per kb) is not consistent with the occurrence of multiple, highly diverged genomes. The expansion of mating-related genes suggests the existence of cryptic sex-related processes. A comparison of gene categories confirms that R. irregularis is close to the Mucoromycotina. The AMF obligate biotrophy is not explained by genome erosion or any related loss of metabolic complexity in central metabolism, but is marked by a lack of genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and of genes involved in toxin and thiamine synthesis. A battery of mycorrhiza-induced secreted proteins is expressed in symbiotic tissues. The present comprehensive repertoire of R. irregularis genes provides a basis for future research on symbiosis-related mechanisms in Glomeromycota.},

Among seven plant extracts showing direct growth-inhibitory activity, the strongest effect was shown by Arctostaphylos uva- -ursi (bearberry) leaves. Many plants stimulated violacein production by wild-type C. violaceum ATCC 31532 in a non-specific manner, and only the herb Bidens tripartita (three-lobe beggarticks) contained compounds that mimic acyl-homoserine lactone and operated as a QS agonist. Anti-QS activity was found in eleven plants including Quercus robur (oak) cortex, Betula verrucosa (birch) buds and Eucalyptus viminalis (Manna Gum) leaves. Subsequent statistical analysis showed differences between antimicrobial and anti-QS activities, whereas both activities were defined by phylogenetic position of medical resource plant. Finally, extract from Quercus robur cortex revealed at least two fractions, showing different anti-QS mechanisms. These data confirm that multicomponent anti-infectious mechanisms are used by plants, which may be useful for drug development},

The presence and activity of IAA were demonstrated colorimetrically, by thin-layer chromatography, and by biotests. The associated bacteria varied in their ability to excrete indole compounds (1\textendash 28 \textmu g/ml nutrient broth). Addition of tryptophan to the growth medium enhanced phytohormone production. Upon addition of 200 \textmu g/ml tryptophan, the bacteria isolated from Dendrobium moschatum roots (Sphingomonas sp. 18, Microbacterium sp. 23, Mycobacterium sp. 1, Bacillus sp. 3, and Rhizobium sp. 5) produced 50.2, 53.1, 92.9, 37.6, and 60.4 \textmu g IAA/ml, respectively, while the bacteria isolated from Acampe papillosa roots (Sphingomonas sp. 42, Rhodococcus sp. 37, Cellulomonas sp. 23, Pseudomonas sp. 24, and Micrococcus luteus) produced 69.4, 49.6, 53.9, 31.0, and 39.2 \textmu g IAA/ml. Auxin production depended on cultivation conditions and on the growth phase of the bacterial cultures. Treatment of kidney bean cuttings with bacterial culture liquid promoted formation of a ``root brush'' with a location height 7.4- to 13.4-fold greater than the one in the control samples. The ability of IAA-producing associated bacteria to act as stimulants of the host plant root development is discussed.},

In the 1960s, agricultural specialists predicted that food production would not keep pace with the burgeoning population growth. However, unforeseen advances in plant germplasm improvement (Green Revolution), the unprecedented use of fertilizers, and expanded use of irrigation not only allowed food production to keep up with but also to outpace population (Waggoner, 1994; Dyson, 1999). Forty years ago, 25\% of the world's population went to bed hungry each day. Since that time, improvements in food production have reduced that hungry percentage to about 17\% even as population doubled. Yet, today 0.8 to 1.0 billion people are chronically undernourished (consume fewer than 2,000 calories per day), 100 million preschool children have a vitamin A deficiency, and 400 million women between the ages of 15 to 49 have an iron deficiency leading to anemia (Conway and Toenniessen, 1999). Even in the developed world, micronutrient deficiency due to poor dietary intake is a major problem among the poor. Although on a global scale food production is adequate and consumer prices for food remain low, on the local scale offending discrepancies in food production and availability are causes for concern (Waggoner, 1994; Dyson, 1999).Table I.Agriculture production and resource use, the recent past to the near futureItem196020002030\textendash 2040Food production (Mt)1.8 \texttimes{} 1093.5 \texttimes{} 1095.5 \texttimes{} 109Population (billions)\hspace{0.6em}368 (maybe 10)Irrigated land (\% of arable)101820Cultivated land (hectares)1.3 \texttimes{} 1091.5 \texttimes{} 1091.8 \texttimes{} 109Water-stressed countries202852N fertilizer use (Tg)1088120P fertilizer use (Tg)\hspace{0.6em}94055\textendash 60Data derived from United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization,Waggoner (1994), Bumb and Baanante (1996), Rosegrant (1997), Dyson (1999), Smil (1999), Tilman et al.

However, with the recent availability of AM fungal genome sequences and transcriptomes major progress has been made to get insight into the fungal components that control this interaction. In this review we summarize these recent molecular insights, especially from the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis, with a focus on plant-fungus communication, (reciprocal) nutrient exchange, and the genetic make-up of AM fungi.},

Several types of proteins are common and have been classified into 17 families of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs). Others have so far been found to occur more specifically in some plant species. Most PRs and related proteins are induced through the action of the signaling compounds salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, or ethylene, and possess antimicrobial activities in vitro through hydrolytic activities on cell walls, contact toxicity, and perhaps an involvement in defense signaling. However, when expressed in transgenic plants, they reduce only a limited number of diseases, depending on the nature of the protein, plant species, and pathogen involved. As exemplified by the PR-1 proteins in Arabidopsis and rice, many homologous proteins belonging to the same family are regulated developmentally and may serve different functions in specific organs or tissues. Several defense-related proteins are induced during senescence, wounding or cold stress, and some possess antifreeze activity. Many defense-related proteins are present constitutively in floral tissues and a substantial number of PR-like proteins in pollen, fruits, and vegetables can provoke allergy in humans. The evolutionary conservation of similar defense-related proteins in monocots and dicots, but also their divergent occurrence in other conditions, suggest that these proteins serve essential functions in plant life, whether in defense or not.},

A key prediction of biological market theory is that individuals can influence resource value \textendash{} meaning the amount a partner is willing to pay for it \textendash{} by mediating where and when it is traded. The arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, characterised by roots and fungi trading phosphorus and carbon, shows many features of a biological market. However, it is unknown if or how fungi can control phosphorus value when exposed to abrupt changes in their trade environment. We mimicked an economic `crash', manually severing part of the fungal network (Rhizophagus irregularis) to restrict resource access, and an economic `boom' through phosphorus additions. We quantified trading strategies over a 3-wk period using a recently developed technique that allowed us to tag rock phosphate with fluorescing quantum dots of three different colours. We found that the fungus: compensated for resource loss in the `crash' treatment by transferring phosphorus from alternative pools closer to the host root (Daucus carota); and stored the surplus nutrients in the `boom' treatment until root demand increased. By mediating from where, when and how much phosphorus was transferred to the host, the fungus successfully controlled resource value.},

While the fungal partner is dependent on the plant host for its carbon (C) needs, the amount of nutrients that the fungus allocates to hosts can vary with context. Because fungal allocation patterns to hosts can change over time, they have historically been difficult to quantify accurately. We developed a technique to tag rock phosphorus (P) apatite with fluorescent quantum-dot (QD) nanoparticles of three different colors, allowing us to study nutrient transfer in an in vitro fungal network formed between two host roots of different ages and different P demands over a 3-week period. Using confocal microscopy and raster image correlation spectroscopy, we could distinguish between P transfer from the hyphae to the roots and P retention in the hyphae. By tracking QD-apatite from its point of origin, we found that the P demands of the younger root influenced both: (1) how the fungus distributed nutrients among different root hosts and (2) the storage patterns in the fungus itself. Our work highlights that fungal trade strategies are highly dynamic over time to local conditions, and stresses the need for precise measurements of symbiotic nutrient transfer across both space and time.},

Sequences of the amplification products showed high interspecies variability and PCR taxon-discriminating primers were designed to distinguish between each of these four fungi. A nested PCR, using universal eukaryotic primers for the first amplification and taxon-discriminating primers for the second, was performed on individual trypan blue-stained mycorrhizal root fragments of onion and leek, and root colonization by four fungi inoculated together in a microcosm experiment was estimated. More than one fungus was detected in the majority of root fragments and all four fungi frequently co-existed within the same root fragment. Root colonization by G. mosseae and G. intraradices was similar from individual and mixed inoculum, whilst the frequency of S. castanea and Gig. rosea increased in the presence of the two Glomus species, suggesting that synergistic interactions may exist between some arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.},

  abstract = {Invasion of natural ecosystems by exotic plant species is a major threat to biodiversity. Disturbance to native plant communities, whether natural or management induced, is a primary factor contributing to successful invasion by exotic plant species. Herbivory by both wild and domestic ungulates exerts considerable impact on structure and composition of native plant communities. Intensive herbivory by ungulates can enhance exotic plant invasion, establishment, and spread for three reasons: (1) many exotic plants are adapted to ground disturbances such as those caused by ungulate feeding, trampling, and movements; (2) many exotic plants are adapted for easy transport from one area to another by ungulates via endozoochory and epizoochory; (3) many exotic plants are not palatable or are of low palatability to ungulates, and consequently, their survival is favored as ungulates reduce or eliminate palatable, native plants. Ungulate herbivory is a chronic, landscape-scale disturbance capable of influencing plant communities as much as episodic events such as fire. Consequently, ungulate herbivory has the potential to facilitate the invasion and establishment of exotic plants in the interior Pacific Northwest where ungulates occupy nearly every ecosystem. Moreover, ungulate herbivory has intensified in many ecosystems, owing to the addition of domestic ungulates with that of existing, wild ungulates, coupled with the reduction or elimination of migratory movements and predators that previously regulated wild ungulate populations and influenced their distributions. Despite the observational evidence for ungulate herbivory as a strong facilitator of exotic plant invasion and establishment, current knowledge of cause-effect relations is severely limited by a lack of manipulative experiments. Most studies have been observational, unreplicated, and lack the experimental controls needed to eliminate or account for confounding sources of variation. Heightened attention to conservation of biodiversity will increase the importance of managing ungulates in balance with the plant communities that support them.},

Nonetheless, most terrestrial ecosystems also contain a considerable number of nonmycorrhizal plants. The interaction of such non-host plants with AM fungi (AMF) is still poorly understood. Here, in three complementary experiments, we investigated whether the non-mycorrhizal plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the model organism for plant molecular biology and genetics, interacts with AMF. We grew A. thaliana alone or together with a mycorrhizal host species (either Trifolium pratense or Lolium multiflorum) in the presence or absence of the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis. Plants were grown in a dualcompartment system with a hyphal mesh separating roots of A. thaliana from roots of the host species, avoiding direct root competition. The host plants in the system ensured the presence of an active AM fungal network. AM fungal networks caused growth depressions in A. thaliana of more than 50\% which were not observed in the absence of host plants. Microscopy analyses revealed that R. irregularis supported by a host plant was capable of infecting A. thaliana root tissues (up to 43\% of root length colonized), but no arbuscules were observed. The results reveal high susceptibility of A. thaliana to R. irregularis, suggesting that A. thaliana is a suitable model plant to study non-host/AMF interactions and the biological basis of AM incompatibility.},

Little is known about the evolutionary processes that shape the composition of these fungal assemblages, nor is it known whether more diverse assemblages are beneficial to crop productivity. In this review we aim to identify the evolutionary selection pressures that shape AMF diversity in agricultural systems and explore whether promotion of AMF diversity can convincingly be linked to increases in agricultural productivity and/or sustainability. We then ask whether farmers can (and should) actively modify evolutionary selection pressures to increase AMF functioning. We focus on three agriculturally imposed selection regimes: tillage, fertilization, and continuous monoculture. We find that the uniform nature of these practices strongly selects for dominance of few AMF species. These species exhibit predictable, generally non-beneficial traits, namely heavy investment in reproduction at the expense of nutrient scavenging and transfer processes that are beneficial for hosts. A number of focus-points are given based on empirical and theoretical evidence that could be utilized to slow down negative selection pressures on AMF functioning, therein increasing crop benefit.},

After extensive root colonization by the fungi, the other half of the divided root system was inoculated with G. mosseae. Prior colonization of one half of the split root system with any of the three fungi resulted in a clear suppression of colonization by G. mosseae in the other half of the root system. As carbohydrates are one of the principal elements of plant growth, AM colonization, which is supposed to present a carbon sink, on one half of the split root system, could affect root growth and thus root fresh weight, on the non-mycorrhizal half of the root system. Besides, the improved P-status of mycorrhizal plants has been suggested to affect further AM root colonization. Our experiment showed that neither the root fresh weight, nor the P-concentration differed significantly in split root systems of non-mycorrhizal control plants and in split root systems of half mycorrhizal plants. Thus the suppressional effect in prior AM colonized plants on subsequent AM root colonization seemed not to be linked to a competition of the AM fungi for carbohydrates or an altered P-status. A systemic suppression of further mycorrhization in mycorrhizal roots, which is not AM fungal species or genera specific is discussed.},

  abstract = {Biological invasions cause ecological and economic impacts across the globe. However, it is unclear whether there are strong patterns in terms of their major effects, how the vulnerability of different ecosystems varies and which ecosystem services are at greatest risk. We present a global meta-analysis of 199 articles reporting 1041 field studies that in total describe the impacts of 135 alien plant taxa on resident species, communities and ecosystems. Across studies, alien plants had a significant effect in 11 of 24 different types of impact assessed. The magnitude and direction of the impact varied both within and between different types of impact. On average, abundance and diversity of the resident species decreased in invaded sites, whereas primary production and several ecosystem processes were enhanced. While alien N-fixing species had greater impacts on N-cycling variables, they did not consistently affect other impact types. The magnitude of the impacts was not significantly different between island and mainland ecosystems. Overall, alien species impacts are heterogeneous and not unidirectional even within particular impact types. Our analysis also reveals that by the time changes in nutrient cycling are detected, major impacts on plant species and communities are likely to have already occurred.},

Mechanisms that drive P limitation, and their interactions with the N cycle, have received less attention than mechanisms causing N limitation. We identify and discuss six mechanisms that could drive P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. The best known of these is depletion-driven limitation, in which accumulated P losses during long-term soil and ecosystem development contribute to what Walker and Syers termed a ``terminal steady state'' of profound P depletion and limitation. The other mechanisms are soil barriers that prevent access to P; transactional limitation, in which weathering of P-containing minerals does not keep pace with the supply of other resources; low-P parent materials; P sinks; and anthropogenic changes that increase the supply of other resources (often N) relative to P. We distinguish proximate nutrient limitation (which occurs where additions of a nutrient stimulate biological processes, especially productivity) from ultimate nutrient limitation (where additions of a nutrient can transform ecosystems). Of the mechanisms that drive P limitation, we suggest that depletion, soil barriers, and low-P parent material often cause ultimate limitation because they control the ecosystem mass balance of P. Similarly, demand-independent losses and constraints to N fixation can control the ecosystem-level mass balance of N and cause it to be an ultimate limiting nutrient.},

We studied the transfer of carbon through this fungal network, from a Medicago truncatula donor plant to a receiver (1) M. truncatula plant growing under decreased light conditions and (2) M. truncatula seedling. Autotrophic plants were grown in bicompartmented Petri plates, with their root systems physically separated, but linked by the extraradical network of Glomus intraradices. A control Myc-/Nod- M. truncatula plant was inserted in the same compartment as the receiver plant. Following labeling of the donor plant with 13CO2, 13C was recovered in the donor plant shoots and roots, in the extraradical mycelium and in the receiver plant roots. Fatty acid analysis of the receiver's roots further demonstrated 13C enrichment in the fungal-specific lipids, while almost no label was detected in the plant-specific compounds. We conclude that carbon was transferred from the donor to the receiver plant via the AM fungal network, but that the transferred carbon remained within the intraradical AM fungal structures of the receiver's root and was not transferred to the receiver's plant tissues.},

We characterized and analyzed the expression of Pi transporters of the Pht1 family in both plant species, and identified two new AM-inducible Pi transporters in flax. Mycorrhizal Pi acquisition was strongly affected by the combination of plant and AM fungal species. A corresponding change in the expression of two AM-inducible Pht1 transporters was noticed in both plants (SbPT9, SbPT10, LuPT5 and LuPT8), but the effect was very weak. Overall, the expression level of these genes did not explain why flax took up more Pi from the CMN than did sorghum. The post-transcriptional regulation of the transporters and their biochemical properties may be more important for their function than the fine-tuning of their gene expression.},

Although substantial amounts of resources are exchanged, the factors that regulate trade in the AM symbiosis are poorly understood. Recent evidence for the reciprocally regulated exchange of resources by AM fungi and plants has led to the suggestion that these symbioses operate according to biological market dynamics, in which interactions are viewed from an economic perspective, and the most beneficial partners are favoured. Here we present five arguments that challenge the importance of reciprocally regulated exchange, and thereby market dynamics, for resource exchange in the AM symbiosis, and suggest that such reciprocity is only found in a subset of symbionts, under specific conditions. We instead propose that resource exchange in the AM symbiosis is determined by competition for surplus resources, functional diversity and sink strength.},

However, little is known about the contributions of rhizobia or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to yield increases and N acquisition in the intercropping system. Plus, the mechanisms controlling carbon (C) and N allocation in intercropping systems remain unsettled. In the present study, a greenhouse experiment combined with (15)N and (13)C labeling was conducted using various inoculation and nutrient treatments. The results showed that co-inoculation with AMF and rhizobia dramatically increased biomass and N content of soybean and maize, and moderate application of N and phosphorus largely amplified the effect of co-inoculation. Maize had a competitive advantage over soybean only under co-inoculation and moderate nutrient availability conditions, indicating that the effects of AMF and rhizobia in intercropping systems are closely related to nutrient status. Results from (15)N labeling showed that the amount of N transferred from soybean to maize in co-inoculations was 54\% higher than that with AMF inoculation alone, with this increased N transfer partly resulting from symbiotic N fixation. The results from (13)C labeling showed that (13)C content increased in maize shoots and decreased in soybean roots with AMF inoculation compared to uninoculated controls. Yet, with co-inoculation, (13)C content increased in soybean. These results indicate that photosynthate assimilation is stimulated by AM symbiosis in maize and rhizobial symbiosis in soybean, but AMF inoculation leads to soybean investing more carbon than maize into common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Overall, the results herein demonstrate that the growth advantage of maize when intercropped with soybean is due to acquisition of N by maize via CMNs while this crop contributes less C into CMNs than soybean under co-inoculation conditions.},

  abstract = {Above- and below-ground organisms can interact by altering the quality of shared host plants. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) influence plant nutrient uptake, including nitrogen (N) acquisition. Under low N and phosphorus conditions, AMF delivery of N from organic sources not immediately available to the plant can have large impacts on plant N status, a limiting nutrient in the aphid diet. This study investigated the effect of AMF colonisation upon aphid number and determined the consequences of AMF directly accessing an organic nutrient patch that the plant cannot. We hypothesised that AMF colonisation of plants will increase plant and aphid N status, plant performance and aphid number, but only when the AMF had direct access to the added organic patch. Barley plants hosting the grain aphid Sitobion avenae were colonised by the AMF, Funneliformis mosseae, or no AMF. A two-compartment microcosm was used to separate the plant roots from a 15N-labelled organic patch in a second compartment. AMF-colonised plants, but without access to the second compartment, were used to examine the effect of AMF colonisation on aphid number. In a separate treatment, and to determine whether AMF access to a plant inaccessible N source modified the effect of AMF colonisation on aphid number, AMF hyphae were permitted access to the second compartment containing an organic patch. As a control for AMF accessing a larger substrate volume, AMF were allowed access to a second compartment without an organic patch. When the AMF accessed the organic patch, more N from the patch was delivered to the plant resulting in a higher grain N concentration although plant growth was depressed. More N from the patch was also delivered to the aphids, but the N status of the aphid remained unchanged. Regardless of the level of access to the organic patch, AMF colonisation did not affect aphid number. Our data show that by accessing N sources not readily available to plants, AMF can indirectly deliver N to above-ground organisms, a finding which has major implications for N-transfer between higher trophic levels.

The symbiosis is thought to have afforded green plants the opportunity to invade dry land ca 450 Ma ago and the vast majority of extant terrestrial plants retain this association. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi perform various ecological functions in exchange for host photosynthetic carbon that almost always contribute to the fitness of hosts from an individual to community level. Recent AM fungal research, increasingly delving into the `Black Box', suggests that species in this phylum may play a key facilitative role in below-ground micro- and meso-organism community dynamics, even more perhaps, that of a bioengineer. The ubiquitous nature of the symbiosis in extant flora and the fact that variations from the AM symbiosis are recent events suggest that Glomeromycota and plant roots coevolved. This review considers aspects of AM fungal ecology emphasizing past and present importance of the phylum in niche to global ecosystem function. Nutrient exchange, evolution, taxonomy, phenology, below-ground microbial interaction, propagule dissemination, invasive plants interactions, the potential role in phytoremediation and some of the factors affecting AM fungal biology are discussed. We conclude that it is essential to include AM association in any study of higher plants in natural environments in order to provide an holistic understanding of ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhiza is a mutually beneficial biological association between species in the fungal phylum Glomeromycota and higher plants roots. The symbiosis is thought to have afforded green plants the opportunity to invade dry land ca 450 Ma ago and the vast majority of extant terrestrial plants retain this association. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi perform various ecological functions in exchange for host photosynthetic carbon that almost always contribute to the fitness of hosts from an individual to community level. Recent AM fungal research, increasingly delving into the `Black Box', suggests that species in this phylum may play a key facilitative role in below-ground micro- and meso-organism community dynamics, even more perhaps, that of a bioengineer. The ubiquitous nature of the symbiosis in extant flora and the fact that variations from the AM symbiosis are recent events suggest that Glomeromycota and plant roots coevolved. This review considers aspects of AM fungal ecology emphasizing past and present importance of the phylum in niche to global ecosystem function. Nutrient exchange, evolution, taxonomy, phenology, below-ground microbial interaction, propagule dissemination, invasive plants interactions, the potential role in phytoremediation and some of the factors affecting AM fungal biology are discussed. We conclude that it is essential to include AM association in any study of higher plants in natural environments in order to provide an holistic understanding of ecosystems.},

The exchange of nutrients between host plants and AM fungi (AMF) is presumed to be the main benefit for the two symbiotic partners. In this review article, we outline the current concepts of nutrient exchanges within this symbiosis (mechanisms and regulation). First, we focus on phosphorus and nitrogen transfer from the fungal partner to the host plant, and on the reciprocal transfer of carbon compounds, with a highlight on a possible interplay between nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition during AM symbiosis. We further discuss potential mechanisms of regulation of these nutrient exchanges linked to membrane dynamics. The review finally addresses the common mycorrhizal networks formed AMF, which interconnect plants from similar and/or different species. Finally the best way to integrate this knowledge and the ensuing potential benefits of AM into sustainable agriculture is discussed.},

SYMRK (symbiosis receptor kinase) is required for early signal transduction leading to plant root symbioses with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Amino acid substitutions in positions critical for activity of other related kinases cause a nonsymbiotic plant phenotype, suggesting that SYMRK kinase activity is required for symbiosis. SYMRK is capable of intermolecular autophosphorylation. Nonphosphorylated SYMRK is less active than the phosphorylated version, suggesting the phosphorylation status of SYMRK determines its activity. Three Ser/Thr residues were identified as residues required for full kinase activation through targeted mutagenesis. Using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, two of these were confirmed to be phosphorylated \emph{in vitro}. These crucial phosphorylation sites are conserved among various plant receptor-like kinases as well as animal Pelle/interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase.

There is very little host specificity in this interaction, however host preferences as well as varying symbiotic efficiencies have been observed. We hypothesize that secreted proteins (SPs) may act as fungal effectors to control symbiotic efficiency in a host-dependent manner. Therefore, we studied whether arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi adjust their secretome in a host- and stage-dependent manner to contribute to their extremely wide host range. We investigated the expression of SP-encoding genes of Rhizophagus irregularis in three evolutionary distantly related plant species, Medicago truncatula, Nicotiana benthamiana and Allium schoenoprasum. In addition we used laser microdissection in combination with RNA-seq to study SP expression at different stages of the interaction in Medicago. Our data indicate that most expressed SPs show roughly equal expression levels in the interaction with all three host plants. In addition, a subset shows significant differential expression depending on the host plant. Furthermore, SP expression is controlled locally in the hyphal network in response to host-dependent cues. Overall, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of the R. irregularis secretome, which now offers a solid basis to direct functional studies on the role of fungal SPs in AM symbiosis.},

We quantitatively analyzed the potential role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in enhancing grain yields of seven cereal crops with exceptional importance for human nutrition across the globe: corn, wheat, rice, barley, sorghum, millet and oat. We conducted a meta-analysis for three datasets including both English and Chinese language publications: the `whole' dataset including both laboratory and field studies (168 articles); the `field' dataset comprising only field studies (97 studies); and the `field-inoculation' dataset including only AM fungal inoculation studies conducted in field conditions (70 articles). We found that the AM fungal effect on grain yield was less pronounced in field and noninoculation studies. AM fungal inoculation in field led to a 16\% increase (overall effect) based on the `field-inoculation' dataset; this effect was variable (77\% trials had positive values), crop-specific, lower for new cultivars released after 1950 and further modulated by soil pH. Although there are neutral and negative effects of AM fungi on grain yields, we emphasize the importance of integrating AM fungi in sustainable agriculture to increase grain yields of cereal crops.},

In this study, we examined whether there was a potential link between carbon (C) release from an AMF and phosphorus (P) availability via a phosphate-solubilizing bacterium (PSB). We investigated the outcome of the interaction between the AMF and the PSB by conducting a microcosm and two Petri plate experiments. An in vitro culture experiment was also conducted to determine the direct impact of AMF hyphal exudates on growth of the PSB. The AMF released substantial C to the environment, triggering PSB growth and activity. In return, the PSB enhanced mineralization of organic P, increasing P availability for the AMF. When soil available P was low, the PSB competed with the AMF for P, and its activity was not stimulated by the fungus. When additional P was added to increase soil available P, the PSB enhanced AMF hyphal growth, and PSB activity was also stimulated by the fungus. Our results suggest that an AMF and a free-living PSB interacted to the benefit of each other by providing the C or P that the other microorganism required, but these interactions depended upon background P availability.},

S. meliloti 1021 is the most extensively studied strain to understand the mechanism of SNF and further to study the legume-microbe interaction. In order to provide insight into the metabolic characteristics underlying the SNF mechanism of S. meliloti 1021, there is an increasing demand to reconstruct a metabolic network for the stage of SNF in S. meliloti 1021.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Through an iterative reconstruction process, a metabolic network during the stage of SNF in S. meliloti 1021 was presented, named as iHZ565, which accounts for 565 genes, 503 internal reactions, and 522 metabolites. Subjected to a novelly defined objective function, the in silico predicted flux distribution was highly consistent with the in vivo evidences reported previously, which proves the robustness of the model. Based on the model, refinement of genome annotation of S. meliloti 1021 was performed and 15 genes were re-annotated properly. There were 19.8\% (112) of the 565 metabolic genes included in iHZ565 predicted to be essential for efficient SNF in bacteroids under the in silico microaerobic and nutrient sharing condition.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: As the first metabolic network during the stage of SNF in S. meliloti 1021, the manually curated model iHZ565 provides an overview of the major metabolic properties of the SNF bioprocess in S. meliloti 1021. The predicted SNF-required essential genes will facilitate understanding of the key functions in SNF and help identify key genes and design experiments for further validation. The model iHZ565 can be used as a knowledge-based framework for better understanding the symbiotic relationship between rhizobia and legumes, ultimately, uncovering the mechanism of nitrogen fixation in bacteroids and providing new strategies to efficiently improve biological nitrogen fixation.},

The null hypothesis for all three working hypotheses can be called the Independence hypothesis, which proposes that plant and AMF communities are unrelated. We investigate the assumptions of these hypotheses and the available evidence in support of them. We suggest that community dynamics during secondary succession, including those related to land-use changes, may be explained by the Driver hypothesis, while the dynamics of plant and AMF communities during primary succession may be explained by the Passenger hypothesis. Within-region co-variation of successionally stable plant and AMF communities may be explained by the Habitat hypothesis, while the Independence hypothesis may explain global patterns of plant and AMF communities. These suggestions are tentative, and more evidence from both descriptive and experimental studies is required to assess them. In particular, comparative information is needed about dispersal limitation of plant and AMF communities in dynamic landscapes.},
